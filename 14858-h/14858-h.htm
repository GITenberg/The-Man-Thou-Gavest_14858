<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>The passengers, one by one, left the train but Truedale took no
heed. He was the only one left at last, but he was not aware of it,
and then, just as the darkness outside caught his attention, the
train stopped so suddenly that it nearly threw him from his
seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accident?&rdquo; he asked the conductor. &ldquo;No, sah!
Pine Cone station. I reckon the engineer come mighty nigh
forgetting&mdash;he generally does at the end. The tracks stop
here. You look mighty peaked; some one expecting
yo&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been ill. My doctor ordered me to the hills.
Yes: some one will meet me.&rdquo; Truedale did not resent the
interest the man showed; he was grateful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sah, if yo&rsquo; man doesn&rsquo;t show
up&mdash;an&rsquo; sometimes they don&rsquo;t, owing to bad
roads&mdash;you can come back with us after we load up with the
wood. I live down the track five miles; we lie thar fur the night.
Yo&rsquo; don&rsquo;t look equal to taking to yo&rsquo; two
standing feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entire train force of three men went to gather fuel for the
return trip and, dejectedly, Truedale sat down in the gloom and
silence to await events.</p>
<p>No human being materialized and Truedale gave himself up to
gloomy thoughts. Evidently he must return on the train and
to-morrow morning take to&mdash;just then a spark like a falling
star attracted his attention and to his surprise he saw, not a
dozen feet away, a tall lank man leaning against a tree in an
attitude so adhesive that he might have been a fungus growth or
sprig of destroying mistletoe. It never occurred to Truedale that
this indifferent onlooker could be interested in him, but he might
be utilized in the emergency, so he saluted cordially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the upward and downward curve of the glowing pipe bowl,
Truedale concluded the man was nodding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for Jim White.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; The one word came through the darkness without
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you&mdash;get me to his place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon. That&rsquo;s what I come ter do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I had a trunk sent on ahead; perhaps it is in
that shed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to&mdash;to Jim&rsquo;s place. Can you ride
behind me on the mare? Travelling is tarnation bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once they were on the mare&rsquo;s back, conversation dragged,
then died a natural death. Truedale felt as if he were living a bit
of anti-war romance as he jogged along behind his guide, his grip
knocking unpleasantly against his leg as the way got rougher.</p>
<p>It was nine o&rsquo;clock when, in a little clearing close by
the trail, the lights of a cabin shone cheerily and the mare
stopped short and definitely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope White is at home!&rdquo; Truedale was worn to the
verge of exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be Jim White!&rdquo; The man dismounted and stood ready
to assist his guest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, stranger. Any one old Doc McPherson sends here
brings his welcome with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About a fortnight later, Conning Truedale stretched his long
legs out toward Jim White&rsquo;s roaring fire of pine knots and
cones. It was a fierce and furious fire but the night was sharp and
cold. There was no other light in the room than that of the
fire&mdash;nor was any needed.</p>
<p>Jim sat by the table cleaning a gun. Truedale was taking account
of himself. He held his long, brown hand up to the blaze; it was as
steady as that of a statue! He had walked ten miles that day and
felt exhilarated. Night brought sleep, meal time&mdash;and often in
between times&mdash;brought appetite. He had made an immense gain
in health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have I been here, Jim?&rdquo; he asked in a
slow, calm voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come Thursday, three weeks!&rdquo; When Jim was most
laconic he was often inwardly bursting with desire for
conversation. After a silence Conning spoke again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Jim, are there any other people in this mountain
range, except you and me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! just bristlin&rsquo; with folks! Getting too darned
thick. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve got ter get into the deep woods.
I just naturally hate folks except in small doses.
Why&rdquo;&mdash;here Jim put the gun down upon the
table&mdash;&ldquo;five mile back, up on Lone Dome, is the
Greyson&rsquo;s, and it ain&rsquo;t nine miles to Jed
Martin&rsquo;s place. Miss Lois Ann&rsquo;s is a matter o&rsquo;
sixteen miles; what do you call population if them figures
don&rsquo;t prove it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something had evidently disturbed White&rsquo;s ideas of
isolation and independence&mdash;it would all come out later.
Truedale knew his man fairly well by that time; at least he thought
he did. Again Jim took up his gun and Con thought lazily that he
must get over to his shack. He occupied a small cabin&mdash;Dr.
McPherson&rsquo;s property for sleeping purposes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do yo&rsquo; know,&rdquo; Jim broke in suddenly;
&ldquo;yo&rsquo; mind me of a burr runnin&rsquo; wild in a flock of
sheep&mdash;gatherin&rsquo; as yo&rsquo; go. Yo&rsquo; sho are a
miracle! Now old Doc McPherson was like a shadder when he headed
this way&mdash;but he took longer gatherin&rsquo;, owin&rsquo; to
age an&rsquo; natural defects o&rsquo; build. Your frame was picked
right close, but a kind o&rsquo; flabby layer of gristle and fat
hung ter him an&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t a good foundation to build
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conning gave a delighted laugh. Once Jim White began to talk of
his own volition his discourse flowed on until hunger or weariness
overtook him. His silences had the same quality&mdash;it was the
way Jim began that mattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I first took ter handlin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; for ole
Doc McPherson, I kinder hated ter take my eyes off yo&rsquo;
fearin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; might slip out, but Gawd! yo&rsquo; can
grapple fo&rsquo; yo&rsquo; self now and&mdash;I plain hanker fur
the sticks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sticks?&rdquo; This was a new expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woods!&rdquo; Jim vouchsafed (he despised the stupidity
that required interpretation of perfectly plain English),
&ldquo;deep woods! What with Burke Lawson suspected of bein&rsquo;
nigh, an&rsquo; my duty as sheriff consarnin&rsquo; him
hittin&rsquo; me in the face, I&rsquo;ve studied it out that it
will be a mighty reasonable trick fur this here officer of the law
to be somewhere else till Burke settles with his friends an&rsquo;
foes, or takes himself off, &rsquo;fore he&rsquo;s strung up or
shot up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale turned his chair about and faced Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
mentioned more names in the last ten minutes than you&rsquo;ve
mentioned in all the weeks I&rsquo;ve been here? You give me a
mental cramp. Why, I thought you and I had these hills to
ourselves; instead we&rsquo;re threatened on every side, and yet I
haven&rsquo;t seen a soul on my tramps. Where do they keep
themselves? What has this Burke Lawson done, to stir the
people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t call your santers real tramps, do you?
Why folks is as thick as ticks up here, though they don&rsquo;t
knock elbows like what they do where you cum from. They don&rsquo;t
holler out ter &rsquo;tract yer attention, neither. But
they&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear more of Burke Lawson.&rdquo; Truedale
gripped <i>him</i> from the seething mass of humanity portrayed by
White, as the one promising most colour and interest. &ldquo;Just
where does Burke live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burke? Gawd! Burke don&rsquo;t live anywhere. He is a
born floater. He scrooges around a place and raises the devil, then
he just naturally floats off. But he nearly always comes back.
Since the trap-settin&rsquo; a time back, he has been mighty scarce
in these parts; but any day he may turn up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trap, eh? What about that?&rdquo; With this Truedale
turned about again, for Jim, having finished his work on the gun,
had placed the weapon on its pegs on the wall and had drawn near
the fire. He ran his hand through his crisp, gray hair until it
stood on end and gave him a peculiarly bristling appearance. He was
about to enjoy himself. He was as keen for gossip as any cabin
woman of the hills, but Jim was an artist about sharing his
knowledge. However, once he decided to share, he shared
royally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been kinder waitin&rsquo; fur yo&rsquo; to
show some interest in us-all,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
plain sign of yo&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; on. I writ the same to old
Doc McPherson yesterday! &lsquo;When he takes to
noticin&rsquo;,&rsquo; I writ, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s on the
mend.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conning laughed good naturedly. &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m on the
mend, all right,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now as to that trap business,&rdquo; Jim took up the
story, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go back some and tell yo&rsquo;
about the Greysons and Jed Martin&mdash;they all be linked like
sassages. Pete Greyson lives up to Lone Dome. Pete came from stock;
he ain&rsquo;t trash by a long come, but he can act like it!
Pete&rsquo;s forbears drank wine and talked like lords; Pete has
ter rely on mountain dew and that accounts fur the difference in
his goin&rsquo;s-on; but once he&rsquo;s sober, he&rsquo;s
quality&mdash;is Pete. Pete&rsquo;s got two darters&mdash;Marg
an&rsquo; Nella-Rose. Old Doc McPherson use&rsquo; ter call
&rsquo;em types, whatever that means. Marg is a type, sure and
sartin, but Nella-Rose is a little no-count&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
I say. But blame it all, it&rsquo;s Nella-Rose as has set the
mountains goin&rsquo;, so far as I can see. Fellers come
courtin&rsquo; Marg and they just slip through her fingers
an&rsquo; Nella-Rose gets &rsquo;em. She don&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em
&rsquo;cept to play with and torment Marg. Gawd! how them two gals
do get each other edgy. Round about Lone Dome they call Nella-Rose
the doney-gal&mdash;that meaning &lsquo;sweetheart&rsquo;;
she&rsquo;s responsible for more trouble than a b&rsquo;ar with a
sore head, or Burke Lawson on a tear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conning was becoming vitally interested and showed it, to
Jim&rsquo;s delight; this was a dangerous state for White, he was
likely, once started and flattered, to tell more than was
prudent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jed Martin&rdquo;&mdash;Jim gave a
chuckle&mdash;&ldquo;has been tossed between them two gals like a
hot corn pone. He&rsquo;d take Nella-Rose quick enough if
she&rsquo;d have him, but barrin&rsquo; her, he hangs to Marg so as
ter be nigh Nella-Rose in any case. And right here Burke Lawson
figgers. Burke&rsquo;s got two naturs, same as old Satan. Marg can
play on one and get him plumb riled up to anythin&rsquo;;
Nella-Rose can twist him around her finger and make him act like
the Second Coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conning called a halt. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Second
Coming?&rdquo; he asked, his eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning?&mdash;good as a Bible character,&rdquo; Jim
explained huffily. &ldquo;Gawd, man! do your own thinkin&rsquo;. I
can&rsquo;t talk an&rsquo; splanify ter onct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I see. Well, go on, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There be times of the moon when I declare that no-count
Nella-Rose just plain seems possessed; has ter do somethin&rsquo;
and does it! Three months ago, come Saturday, or thereabouts, she
took it into her head to worst Marg at every turn and let it out
that she was goin&rsquo; to round up all the fellers and take her
pick! She had the blazin&rsquo; face ter come down here and tell
<i>me</i> that! Course Marg knew it, but the two most consarned
didn&rsquo;t&mdash;meaning Jed and Burke. Least they
suspected&mdash;but warn&rsquo;t sure. Jed meant to get Burke out
o&rsquo; the way so he could have a clear space to co&rsquo;t
Nella-Rose, so he aimed to shoot one o&rsquo; Burke&rsquo;s feet
just enough to lay him up&mdash;Jed is the slow, calculatin&rsquo;
kind and an almighty sure shot. He reckoned Burke couldn&rsquo;t
walk up Lone Dome with a sore foot, so he laid for him,
meanin&rsquo; afterward to say he was huntin&rsquo; an&rsquo; took
Burke for a &rsquo;possum. Well, Burke got wind of the plot;
I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; Marg put a flea in his ear, anyway he set
a trap just by the path leading from the trail to Lone Dome. Gawd!
Jed planted his foot inter it same as if he meant ter, and what
does that Burke do but take a walk with Nella-Rose right past the
place where Jed was caught! &rsquo;Corse he was yellin&rsquo;
somethin&rsquo; terrible. They helped Jed out and I reckon
Nella-Rose was innocent enough, but Jed writ up the account
&rsquo;gainst Burke and Burke floated off for a spell. He
ain&rsquo;t floated back yet&mdash;not <i>yet!</i> But so long as
Nella-Rose is above ground he&rsquo;ll naturally cum
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Nella-Rose, the little no-count; did she repay Jed,
the poor cuss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nella-Rose don&rsquo;t repay no one&mdash;she ain&rsquo;t
more&rsquo;n half real, whatever way you put it. But just see how
this fixes a sheriff, will yo&rsquo;? Knowing what I do, I
can&rsquo;t jail either o&rsquo; them chaps with a cl&rsquo;ar
conscience. Gawd! I&rsquo;d like to pass a law to cage all females
and only let &rsquo;em out with a string to their legs!&rdquo; Then
White laughed reminiscently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gals!&rdquo; White fairly spit out the word.
&ldquo;Gals!&rdquo; There was an eloquent pause, then more quietly:
&ldquo;Jest when yo&rsquo; place &rsquo;em and hate &rsquo;em
proper, they up and do somethin&rsquo; to melt yo&rsquo; like snow
on Lone Dome in May. I was harkin&rsquo; back to the little white
hen and Nella-Rose. There ain&rsquo;t much chance to have a
livin&rsquo; pet up to Greyson&rsquo;s place. Anything fit to eat
is et. Pete drinks the rest. But once Nella-Rose came totin&rsquo;
up here on a cl&rsquo;ar, moonlight evenin&rsquo; with
somethin&rsquo; under her little, old shawl. &lsquo;Jim&rsquo; she
says&mdash;wheedlin&rsquo; and coaxin&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I want
yo&rsquo; to keep this here hen fo&rsquo; me. I&rsquo;ll bring its
keep, but I love it, and I can&rsquo;t see it&mdash;killed!&rsquo;
That gal don&rsquo;t never let tears fall&mdash;they jest wet her
eyes and make &rsquo;em shine. With that she let loose the most
owdacious white bantam and scattered some corn on the floor; then
she sat down and laughed like an imp when the foolish thing hopped
up to her and flopped onter her lap. Well, I kept the sassy little
hen&mdash;there wasn&rsquo;t anything else ter do&mdash;but one day
Marg, she followed Nella-Rose up and when she saw what was going
on, she stamped in and cried out: &lsquo;So! yo&rsquo; can have
playthings while us-all go starved! Yo&rsquo; can steal
what&rsquo;s our&rsquo;n,&mdash;an&rsquo; with that she took the
bantam and fo&rsquo; I could say a cuss, she wrung that
chicken&rsquo;s neck right fo&rsquo; Nella-Rose&rsquo;s
eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; exclaimed Conning; &ldquo;the young
brute! And the other one&mdash;what did she do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She jest looked at me&mdash;her eyes swimmin&rsquo;.
Nella-Rose don&rsquo;t talk much when she&rsquo;s hurt, but she
don&rsquo;t forget. I tell yo&rsquo;, young feller, bein&rsquo; a
sheriff in this settlement ain&rsquo;t no joke. Yo&rsquo; know
folks too well and see the rights and wrongs more&rsquo;n is good
for plain justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Jim rose and stretched himself,
&ldquo;yo&rsquo; won&rsquo;t go on the b&rsquo;ar hunt
ter-morrer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jim, but I&rsquo;ll walk part of the way with you.
When do you start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout two o&rsquo; the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll turn in. Good-night, old man!
You&rsquo;ve given me a great evening. I feel as if I were suddenly
projected into a crowd with human problems smashing into each other
for all they&rsquo;re worth. You cannot escape, old man;
that&rsquo;s the truth. You cannot escape. Life is life no matter
where you find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t git ter talkin&rsquo; perlite to
me,&rdquo; Jim warned. &ldquo;Old Doc McPherson&rsquo;s orders was
agin perlite conversation. Get a scrabble on yer! I&rsquo;ll knock
yer up &rsquo;bout two or thereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside, Truedale stood still and looked at the beauty of the
night. The moon was full and flooded the open space with a radiance
which contrasted sharply with the black shadows and the outlines of
the near and distant peaks.</p>
<p>The silence was so intense that the ear, straining for sound,
ached from the effort. And just then a bewitched hen in
White&rsquo;s shed gave a weird cry and Truedale started. He smiled
grimly and thought of the little no-count and the tragedy of the
white bantam. In the shining light around him he seemed to see her
pitiful face as White had described it&mdash;the eyes full of tears
but never overflowing, the misery and hate, the loneliness and
impotency.</p>
<p>At two the next morning Jim tapped on Truedale&rsquo;s window
with his gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comin&rsquo; fur a walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; Con was awake at once and alert. Ten
minutes later, closing the doors and windows of his cabin after
him, he joined White on the leaf-strewn path to the woods. He went
five miles and then bade his host good-bye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t overwork!&rdquo; grinned Jim sociably.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write to old Doc McPherson when I git
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when will that be, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; ter predict.&rdquo; White set
his lips. &ldquo;When I stay, I stay, but once I take ter the woods
there ain&rsquo;t no sayin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll fetch fodder when I
cum, and mail, too&mdash;but I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; ter hobble
myself when I take ter the sticks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tramping back alone over the wet autumn leaves, Truedale had his
first sense of loneliness since he came. White, he suddenly
realized, had meant to him everything that he needed, but with
White unhobbled in the deep woods, how was he to fill the time? He
determined to force himself to study. He had wedged one solid
volume in his trunk, unknown to his friends. He would brush up his
capacity for work&mdash;it could not hurt him now. He was as strong
as he had ever been in his life and the prospect ahead promised
greater gains.</p>
<p>Yes, he would study. He would write letters, too&mdash;real
letters. He had neglected every one, especially Lynda Kendall. The
others did not matter, but Lynda mattered more than anything. She
always would! And thinking of Lynda reminded him that he had also,
in his trunk, the play upon which he had worked for several years
during hours that should have been devoted to rest. He would get
out the play and try to breathe life into it, now that he himself
was living. Lynda had said, when last they had discussed his work,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful, Con; you shall not belittle it. It is
beautiful like a cold, stone thing with rough edges. Sometime you
must smooth it and polish it, and then you must pray over it and
believe in it, and I really think it will repay you. It may not
mean anything but a sure guide to your goal, but you&rsquo;d be
grateful for that, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Of course he would be
grateful for that! It would mean life to him&mdash;life, not mere
existence. He began to hope that Jim White would stay away a month;
what with study, and the play, and the doing for himself, the time
ahead was provided for already!</p>
<p>Stalking noiselessly forward, Truedale came into the clearing,
passed White&rsquo;s shack, and approached his own with a fixed
determination. Then he stopped short. He was positive that he had
closed windows and doors&mdash;the caution of the city still clung
to him&mdash;but now both doors and windows were set wide to the
brilliant autumn day and a curl of smoke from a lately replenished
fire cheerfully rose in the clear, dry air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;!&rdquo; and then Truedale
quietly slipped to the rear of the cabin and to a low, sliding
window through which he could peer, unobserved. One glance
transfixed him.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>The furnishing of the room was bare and plain&mdash;a deal
table, a couple of wooden chairs, a broad comfortable couch, a
cupboard with some nondescript crockery, and a good-sized mirror in
the space between the front door and the window. Before this glass
a strange figure was walking to and fro, enjoying hugely its own
remarkable reflection. Truedale&rsquo;s bedraggled bath robe hung
like a mantle from the shoulders of the intruder&mdash;they were
very straight, slim young shoulders; an old ridiculous fez&mdash;an
abomination of his freshman year, kept for sentimental
reasons&mdash;adorned the head of the small stranger and only
partly held in check the mass of shadowy hair that rippled from it
and around a mischievous face.</p>
<p>Surprise, then wonder, swayed Truedale. When he reached the
wonder stage, thought deserted him. He simply looked and kept on
wondering. Through this confusion, words presently reached him. The
masquerader within was bowing and scraping comically, and in a low,
musical voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How-de, Mister Outlander, sir! How-de? I saw your smoke
a-curling way back from home, sir, and I&rsquo;ve come a-visiting
&rsquo;long o&rsquo; you, Mister Outlander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another sweeping curtsey reduced Truedale to helpless mirth and
he fairly shouted, doubling up as he did so.</p>
<p>The effect of his outburst upon the young person within was
tremendous. She seemed turned to stone. She stared at the face in
the window; she turned red and white&mdash;the absurd fez dangling
over her left ear. Then she emitted what seemed to be one word, so
lingeringly sweet was the drawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Godda&rsquo;mighty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that there was going to be no other concession, Truedale
pulled himself together, went around to the front door and knocked,
ceremoniously. The girl turned, as if on a pivot, but spoke no
word.</p>
<p>She had the most wonderful eyes&mdash;innocent and pleading; she
was a mere child and, although she looked awed now, was evidently a
forward young native who deserved a good lesson. Truedale
determined to give her one!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come in and sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This he did while the big, solemn eyes followed him alertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now will you be kind enough to tell me what you mean
by&mdash;wearing my clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still the silence and the blank stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must answer my questions!&rdquo; Truedale&rsquo;s
voice sounded stern. &ldquo;I suppose you didn&rsquo;t expect me
back so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deep eyes confirmed this by the drooping of the lids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you broke in&mdash;what for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really the situation was becoming unbearable, so Truedale
changed his tactics. He would play with the poor little thing and
reassure her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that I look at you I see what you are. You&rsquo;re
not a human at all. You&rsquo;re a spirit of something or
other&mdash;probably of one of those perky mountains over yonder.
The White Maid, I bet! You had to don my clothes in order to
materialize before my eyes and you had to use that word of the
hills&mdash;so that I could understand you. It&rsquo;s quite plain
now and you are welcome to my&mdash;my bath robe; I dare say that,
underneath it, you are decked out in filmy clouds and vapours and
mists. Oh! come now&mdash;&rdquo; The strange eyes were
filling&mdash;but not overflowing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only joking. Forgive me. Why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wretched fez fell from the soft hair&mdash;the bedraggled
robe from the rigid shoulders&mdash;and there, garbed in a rough
home-spun gown, a little plaid shawl and a checked apron,
stood&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the no-count,&rdquo; thought Truedale. Aloud
he said, &ldquo;Nella-Rose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the dropping of the disguise years and dignity were added
to the girl and Truedale, who was always at his worst in the
presence of strange young women, gazed dazedly at the one before
him now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;he began
awkwardly&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll sit down. Please do!&rdquo; He
drew a chair toward her. Nella-Rose sank into it and leaned her
bowed head upon her arms, which she folded on the table. Her
shoulders rose and fell convulsively, and Truedale, looking at her,
became hopelessly wretched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a beast and nothing less!&rdquo; he admitted by
way of apology and excuse. &ldquo;I&mdash;I wish you <i>could</i>
forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then slowly the head was raised and to Truedale&rsquo;s further
consternation he saw that mirth, not anguish, had caused the
shaking of those deceiving little shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I see&mdash;you are laughing!&rdquo; He tried to be
indignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&mdash;you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; Then, like a response, something
heretofore unknown and unsuspected in Truedale rose and overpowered
him. His shyness and awkwardness melted before the warmth and glow
of the conquering emotion. He got up and sat on the corner of the
table nearest his shabby little guest, and looking straight into
her bewitching eyes he joined her in a long, resounding laugh.</p>
<p>It was surrender, pure and simple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;you must stay and
have a bite. I am about starved. And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl grew sober.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m always hungry,&rdquo; she
admitted softly.</p>
<p>They drew the table close to the roaring fire, leaving doors and
windows open to the crisp, sweet; morning air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a party!&rdquo; Truedale announced.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll step over to Jim&rsquo;s cabin and bring the best
he&rsquo;s got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he returned Nella-Rose had placed cups, saucers, and plates
on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you&mdash;often have parties?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never had one before. I&rsquo;ll have them, though,
from now on if&mdash;if you will come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale paused with his arms full of pitchers and platters of
food, and held the girl with his admiring eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will let me come and see you&mdash;you and your
sister and your father? I know all about you. White has
explained&mdash;everything. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nella-Rose braced herself against the table and quietly and
definitely outlined their future relations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you cannot come to see us-all. You don&rsquo;t know
Marg. If she doesn&rsquo;t find things out, there won&rsquo;t be
trouble; when she does find things out there&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;
t&rsquo; be a right smart lot of trouble brewing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was said with such comical seriousness that Truedale
laughed again, but sobered instantly when he recalled the incident
of the white bantam which Jim had so vividly portrayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you see,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
to let you go after this first party, and never see you
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shrugged her shoulders and apparently dismissed the
matter. She sat down and, with charming abandon, began to eat.
Presently Truedale, amused and interested, spoke again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be very unkind of you not to let me see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;thinking!&rdquo; Nella-Rose drew her
brows together and nibbled a bit of corn bread meditatively.
Then&mdash;quite suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you mean that?&rdquo; Truedale flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And the big woods&mdash;you walk in them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes&mdash;I am in the big woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;specially?&rdquo; Truedale was playing this
new game with the foolish skill of the novice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Hollow&mdash;where&mdash;&rdquo;
(Nella-Rose paused) &ldquo;where the laurel tangle is like a
jungle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale broke in: &ldquo;I know it! There&rsquo;s a little
stream running through it, and&mdash;trails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Nella-Rose leaned back and showed her white
teeth alluringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I should not&mdash;permit this!&rdquo; For a
moment Truedale broke through the thin ice of delight that was
luring him to unknown danger and fell upon the solid rock of
conservatism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; The eyes, so tenderly innocent, confronted
him appealingly. &ldquo;There are nuts there and&mdash;and other
things! You are just teasing; you&rsquo;ll let me&mdash;show you
the way about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was all child now and made Truedale ashamed to hold her
to any absurd course that his standards acknowledged but that hers
had never conceived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ll be glad to have you for a guide.
Jim White has no ideas about nuts and things&mdash;he goes to the
woods to kill something; he&rsquo;s there now. I dare say mere are
other things in the mountains besides&mdash;prey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nella-Rose nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit by the fire!&rdquo; she suddenly said.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I want to tell you&mdash;something, and then I must
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lack of shyness and reserve might so easily have become
boldness&mdash;but they did not! The girl was like a creature of
the wilds which, knowing no reason for fear, was revelling in
heretofore unsuspected enjoyment. Truedale pulled the couch to the
hearth for Nella-Rose, piled the pillows on one end and then seated
himself on the stump of a tree which served as a settee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then!&rdquo; he said, keeping his eyes on his breezy
little guest. &ldquo;What have you got to tell me&mdash;before you
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that happened&mdash;long ago. You
will not laugh if I tell you? You laugh right much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? You think I laugh a good deal? Good Lord! Some folk
think I don&rsquo;t laugh enough.&rdquo; He had his friends back
home in mind, and somehow the memory steadied him for an
instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps they-all don&rsquo;t know you as well
as I do.&rdquo; This with amusing conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Truedale was deadly
solemn. &ldquo;But go on, Nella-Rose. I promise not to laugh
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the beginning of&mdash;you!&rdquo; The girl turned
her eyes to the fire&mdash;she was quaintly demure. &ldquo;At first
when I saw you looking in that window, yonder, I was right
scared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim White&rsquo;s statement that Nella-Rose wasn&rsquo;t more
than half real seemed, in the light of present happenings, little
less than bald fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the way <i>you</i> looked&mdash;way back there
when I was ten years old. I had run away&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you always running away?&rdquo; asked Truedale from
the hollow depths of unreality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I run away a smart lot. You have to if you want
to&mdash;see things and be different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;you want to be different,
Nella-Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;why, can&rsquo;t you see?&mdash;I <i>am</i>
different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I only meant&mdash;do you like to be
different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to like it. I was born with a cawl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In heaven&rsquo;s name, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something over your eyes, and when they take it off you
see more, and farther, than any one else. You&rsquo;re part
ha&rsquo;nt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale wiped his forehead&mdash;the room was getting hot, but
the heat alone was not responsible for his emotions; he was being
carried beyond his depth&mdash;beyond himself&mdash;by the wild
fascination of the little creature before him. He would hardly have
been surprised had a draught of air wafted her out of the window
like a bit of mountain mist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t interrupt so much!&rdquo; She
turned a stern face upon him. &ldquo;I ran away that time to see
a&mdash;railroad train! One of the niggers told me about
it&mdash;he said it was the Bogy Man. I wanted to know, so I went
to the station. It&rsquo;s a right smart way down and I had to
sleep one night under the trees. Don&rsquo;t the stars look starry
sometimes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interruption made Truedale jump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly do,&rdquo; he said, looking at the soft,
dark eyes with their long lashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t afraid&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t hurry. It
was evening, and the sun just a-going down, when I got to the
station. There wasn&rsquo;t any one about so I&mdash;I ran down the
big road the train comes on&mdash;to meet it. And then&rdquo; (here
Nella-Rose clasped her hands excitedly and her breath came short),
&ldquo;and then I saw it a-coming and a-coming. The big fire-eye
a-glaring and the mighty noise a-snorting and I reckoned it was old
Master Satan and I just&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t move!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on! go on!&rdquo; Truedale bent close to her&mdash;she
had caught him in the mesh of her dramatic charm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it a-coming, and set on&mdash;on devouring o&rsquo;
me, and still I couldn&rsquo;t stir. Everything was growing black
and black except a big square with that monster eye a-glaring into
the soul o&rsquo; me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s face was set&mdash;her eyes vacant and wild;
suddenly they softened, and her little white teeth showed through
the childish, parted lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the eye went away, there was a blackness in the
square place, and then a face came&mdash;a kind face it
was&mdash;all a-laughing and it&mdash;it kept going farther and
farther off to one side and I kept a-following and a-following and
then&mdash;the big noise went rushing by me, and there I was right
safe and plump up against a tree!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; Again Truedale wiped his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since then,&rdquo; Nella-Rose relaxed, &ldquo;I can shut
my eyes and always there is the black square and
sometimes&mdash;not always, but sometimes&mdash;things
come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The face, Nella-Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t make that come. But things I want to,
do and have. I always think, when I see things, that I&rsquo;m
going to do a big, fine thing some day. I feel upperty and
then&mdash;poof! off go the pictures and I am just&mdash;lil&rsquo;
Nella-Rose again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A comically heavy sigh brought Truedale back to earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the face you saw long ago,&rdquo; Truedale whispered,
&ldquo;was it my face, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nella-Rose paused&mdash;then quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;reckon it was. Yes, I&rsquo;m mighty sure it was
your face. When I saw it at that window&rdquo;&mdash;she pointed
across the room&mdash;&ldquo;I certainly thought my eyes were
closed and that&mdash;it had come&mdash;the kind, good face that
saved me!&rdquo; A sweet, friendly smile wreathed the girl&rsquo;s
lips and she rose with rare dignity and held out her thin, delicate
hand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mister Outlander, we&rsquo;re going to be neighbours,
aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;neighbours!&rdquo; Truedale took the hand with
a distinct sense of suffocation, &ldquo;but why do you call me an
outlander?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;you are! You&rsquo;re not <i>of</i> our
mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wish I were!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wishing can&rsquo;t make you. You are&mdash;or you
aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale noted the girl&rsquo;s language. Distorted and crude as
it often was, it was never positively illiterate. This surprised
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;oh! you&rsquo;re not going yet!&rdquo; He put
his hand out, for the definite way in which Nella-Rose turned was
ominous. Already she seemed to belong to the cabin room&mdash;to
Truedale himself. Not a suggestion of strangeness clung to her. It
was as if she had always been there but that his eyes had been
holden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait&mdash;oh! Nella-Rose. Let me walk part of the way
with you. I&mdash;I have a thousand things to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she was gone out of the door, down the path.</p>
<p>Truedale stood and looked after her until the long shadows
reached up to Lone Dome&rsquo;s sharpest edge. White&rsquo;s dogs
began nosing about, suggesting attention to affairs nearer at hand.
Then Truedale sighed as if waking from a dream. He performed the
duties Jim had left to his tender mercy&mdash;the feeding of the
animals, the piling up of wood. Then he forced himself to take a
long walk. He ate his evening meal late, and finally sat down to
his task of writing letters. He wrote six to Brace Kendall and tore
them up; he wrote one to his uncle and put it aside for
consideration when the effect of his day dreams left him sane
enough to judge it. Finally he managed a note to Dr. McPherson and
one to Lynda Kendall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think&rdquo;&mdash;so the letter to Lynda
ran&mdash;&ldquo;that I will work regularly, now, on the play. With
more blood in my own body I can hope to put more into that.
I&rsquo;m going to get it out to-morrow and begin the infusion. I
wish you were here to-night&mdash;to see the wonderful effect of
the moon on the mists&mdash;but there! if I said more you might
guess where I am. When I come back I shall try to describe it and
some day you must see it. Several times lately I have imagined an
existence here with one&rsquo;s work and enough to subsist on. No
worry, no nerve-racking, and always the tremendous beauty to
inspire one! Nothing seems wholly real here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Truedale put down his pen. Nella-Rose crowded Lynda Kendall
from the field of vision; later, he simply signed his name and let
the note go with that.</p>
<p>As for Nella-Rose, as soon as she left Truedale, her mind turned
to sterner matters close at hand. She became aware before long of
some one near by. The person, whoever it was, seemed determined to
remain hidden but for that very reason it called out all the
girl&rsquo;s cunning and cleverness. It might be&mdash;Burke
Lawson! With this thought Nella-Rose gasped a little. Then, it
might be Marg; and here the dark eyes grew hard&mdash;the lips
almost cruel! She got down upon her knees and crawled like a
veritable little animal of the wilds. Keeping close to the ground,
she advanced to where the trail from Lone Dome met the broader one,
and there, standing undecided and bewildered, was a tall, fair
girl.</p>
<p>Nella-Rose sprang to her feet, her eyes ablaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marg! What you&mdash;hounding me for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nella-Rose, where you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been up to Devil-may-come Hollow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I? Let me pass, Marg. Have your mully-grubs, if you
please; I&rsquo;m going home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Nella-Rose tried to pass, Marg caught her by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burke&rsquo;s back!&rdquo; she whispered,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s hiding up to Devil-may-come! He&rsquo;s been seen
and you know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if I do?&rdquo; Nella-Rose never ignored a possible
escape for the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been up there&mdash;to meet him. You ought
to be licked. If you don&rsquo;t let him alone&mdash;let him and me
alone&mdash;I&rsquo;ll turn Jed on him, I will; I swear
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he&mdash;to you!&rdquo; Nella-Rose confronted her
sister squarely. Blue eyes&mdash;bold, cold blue they
were&mdash;looked into dark ones even now so soft and winning that
it was difficult to resist them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you let him alone, he&rsquo;ll be everything to
me!&rdquo; Marg blurted out. &ldquo;What do you want of him,
Nella-Rose?&mdash;of him or any other man? But if you must have a
sweetheart, pick and choose and let me have my day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rough appeal struck almost brutally on Nella-Rose&rsquo;s
ears. She was as un-moral, perhaps, as Marg, but she was more
discriminating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty tired of cleaning and cooking
for&mdash;for father and you!&rdquo; Marg tossed her head toward
Lone Dome. &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s mostly always drunk these days and
you&mdash;what do you care what becomes of me? Leave me to get a
man of my own and then I&rsquo;ll be human. I&rsquo;ve
been&mdash;killing the hog to-day!&rdquo; Marg suddenly and
irrelevantly burst out; &ldquo;I&mdash;I shall never do it again.
We&rsquo;ll starve first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t father?&rdquo; Nella-Rose said,
softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father? Huh! he couldn&rsquo;t have held the knife. He
went for the jug&mdash;and got it full! No, I had to do it, but
it&rsquo;s the last time. Nella-Rose, tell me where Burke is
hidden&mdash;tell me! Leave me free to&mdash;to win him; let me
have my chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then who&rsquo;ll kill the pig?&rdquo; Nella-Rose
shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares?&rdquo; Marg flung back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Find him if you can. Fair play&mdash;no favours; what
I find is open to you!&rdquo; Nella-Rose laughed impishly and,
darting past her sister, ran down the path.</p>
<p>Marg stood and watched her with baffled rage and hate. For a
moment she almost decided to take her chances and seek Burke Lawson
in the distant Hollow. But night was coming&mdash;the black, drear
night of the low places. Marg was desperate, but a primitive
conservatism held her. Not for all she hoped to gain would she
brave Burke Lawson alone in the secret places of Devil-may-come
Hollow! So she followed after Nella-Rose and reached home while her
sister was preparing the evening meal.</p>
<p>Peter Greyson, the father, sat huddled in a big chair by the
fire. He had arrived at that stage of returning consciousness when
he felt that it was incumbent upon him to explain himself. He had
been a handsome man, of the dashing cavalry type and he still bore
traces of past glory. In his worst moments he never swore before
ladies, and in his best he remembered what was due them and upheld
their honour and position with fervour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; Nella-Rose,&rdquo; he was saying as Marg
paused outside the door in the dark, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you
marry Burke Lawson and settle down here with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t asked me, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t in any position now to pick and
choose&rdquo;&mdash;this between hiccoughs and yawns&mdash;&ldquo;I
saw him early this morning; I know his back anywhere. I&rsquo;d
just met old Jim White. I reckon Burke was calculating to shoot
Jim, but my coming upset his plans. Shooting a sheriff ain&rsquo;t
safe business.&rdquo; What Greyson really had seen was
Truedale&rsquo;s retreat after parting company with Jim, but not
knowing of Truedale&rsquo;s existence he jumped to the conclusion
which to his fuddled wits seemed probable, and had so informed Marg
upon his return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell yo&rsquo;, Nella-Rose,&rdquo; he ran on,
&ldquo;yo&rsquo; better marry Burke and tame him. There ain&rsquo;t
nothing as tames a man like layin&rsquo; responsibilities on
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, father, let me help you to the table. I don&rsquo;t
want to talk about Burke. I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s
back.&rdquo; She steadied the rolling form to the head of the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell yo&rsquo;, chile, I saw Burke&rsquo;s back;
don&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; reckon I know Lawson when I see him, back or
front? Don&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; want ter marry Lawson,
Nella-Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t have him if he asked me. It would be
like marrying a tree that the freshet was rolling about. I&rsquo;m
not going to seek and hide with any man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; let Marg have &rsquo;im then?
She&rsquo;d be a right smart responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can have him and welcome, if she can find him!&rdquo;
Then, hearing her sister outside, she called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Marg. Shut out the cold and the dark.
What&rsquo;s the use of acting like a little old
hateful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marg slouched in; there was no other word to describe her
indifferent and contemptuous air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming around?&rdquo; she asked, nodding at
her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;he&rsquo;s come,&rdquo; Nella-Rose
admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then, I&rsquo;m going to tell him
something!&rdquo; She walked over to her father and stood before
him, looking him steadily in the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I killed the hog to-day;&rdquo; she spoke
sharply, slowly, as to a dense child. Peter Greyson started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;did that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. While you were off&mdash;getting drunk, and while
Nella-Rose was traipsing back there in the Hollow I killed the hog;
but I&rsquo;ll never do it again. It sickened the soul of me.
I&rsquo;m as good as Nella-Rose&mdash;just as good. If you
can&rsquo;t do your part, father, and she <i>won&rsquo;t</i> do
hers, that&rsquo;s no reason for me being benastied with such work
as I did to-day. You hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I hear you, Marg, and I&rsquo;m plumb humiliated
that&mdash;that I let you. It&mdash;it sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t happen
again. I&rsquo;ll keep a smart watch next year. A gentleman
can&rsquo;t say more to his daughter than that&mdash;can
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saying is all very well&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
doing.&rdquo; Marg was adamant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to look out
for myself from now on. You and Nella-Rose will find
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s come to you, Marg?&rdquo; Peter looked
concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something that hasn&rsquo;t ever come before,&rdquo; Marg
replied, keeping her eyes on Nella-Rose. &ldquo;There be times when
you have to take your life by the throat and strangle it until it
falls into shape. I&rsquo;m gripping mine now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the killing of that hog!&rdquo; groaned Peter.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s stirred you, and I can&rsquo;t blame you. Killing
ain&rsquo;t for a lady; but Lord! what a man you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;
made, Marg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Marg broke in a bit wildly,
&ldquo;and other things are not for&mdash;for women to do and bear.
I&rsquo;m through. It&rsquo;s Nella-Rose and me to share and share
alike, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was nothing more to say&mdash;the pause was eloquent.
The three ate in silence for some moments and then talked of
trivial things. Peter Greyson went early to bed and the sisters
washed the dishes, sharing equally. They did the out-of-door duties
of caring for the scanty live stock, and at last Nella-Rose went to
her tiny room under the eaves, while Marg lay down upon the
living-room couch.</p>
<p>When everything was at rest once more Nella-Rose stole to the
low window of her chamber and, kneeling, looked forth at the
peaceful moonlit scene. How still and white it was and how safe and
strong the high hills looked! What had happened? Why, nothing
<i>could</i> happen and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;Then Nella-Rose
closed her eyes and waited. With all her might she tried to force
the &ldquo;good, kind face&rdquo; to materialize, but to no
purpose. Suddenly an owl hooted hideously and, like a guilty thing,
the girl by the window crept back to bed.</p>
<p>Owls were very wise and they could see things in the dark places
with their wide-open eyes! Just then Nella-Rose could not have
borne any investigation of her throbbing heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>Lynda Kendall closed her desk and wheeled about in her chair
with a perplexed expression on her strong, handsome face. Generally
speaking, she went her way with courage and conviction, but since
Conning Truedale&rsquo;s breakdown, an element in her had arisen
that demanded recognition and she had yet to learn how to control
it and insist upon its subjection.</p>
<p>Her life had been a simple one on the whole, but one requiring
from early girlhood the constant use of her faculties. Whatever
help she had had was gained from the dependence of others upon her,
not hers upon them. She was so strong and sweet-souled that to give
was a joy, it was a joy too, for them that received. That she was
ever tired and longed for strong arms to uphold her rarely occurred
to any one except, perhaps, William Truedale, the invalid uncle of
Conning.</p>
<p>At this juncture of Lynda&rsquo;s career, she shrank from
William Truedale as she never had before. Had Conning died, she
knew she would never have seen the old man again. She believed that
his incapacity for understanding Conning&mdash;his rigid, unfeeling
dealing with him&mdash;had been the prime factor in the physical
breakdown of the younger man. All along she had hoped and believed
that her hold upon old William Truedale would, in the final
reckoning, bring good results; for that reason, and a secret one
that no one suspected, she kept to her course. She paid regular
visits to the old man&mdash;made him dependent upon her, though he
never permitted her to suspect this. Always her purpose had centred
upon Con, who had, at first, appealed to her loyalty and justice,
but of late to something much more personal and tender.</p>
<p>The day&rsquo;s work was done and the workshop, in which the
girl sat, was beginning to look shadowy in the far corners where
evidences of her profession cluttered the dim spaces. She was an
interior decorator, but of such an original and unique kind that
her brother explained her as a &ldquo;Spiritual and Physical
Interpreter.&rdquo; She had learned her trade, but she had
embellished it and permitted it to develop as she herself had grown
and expanded.</p>
<p>Lynda looked now at her wrist-watch; it was four-thirty. The
last mail delivery had brought a short but inspiring note from
Con&mdash;per Dr. McPherson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my grip again, Lynda! The day brings
appetite and strength; the night, sleep! I wonder whether you know
what that means? I begin to believe I am reverting to type, as
McPherson would say, and I&rsquo;m intensely interested in finding
out&mdash;what type? Whenever I think of study, I have an attack of
mental indigestion. There is only one fellow creature to share my
desolation but I am never lonely&mdash;never lacking employment.
I&rsquo;m busy to the verge of exhaustion in doing nothing and
getting well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda smiled. &ldquo;So he&rsquo;s not going to die!&rdquo; she
murmured; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no use in punishing Uncle William
any longer. I&rsquo;ll go up and have dinner with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decision made, and Conning for the moment relegated to
second place, Lynda rose and smiled relievedly. Then her eyes fell
upon her mother&rsquo;s photograph which stood upon her desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going, dear,&rdquo; she confided&mdash;they
were very close, that dead mother and the live, vital
daughter&mdash;&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The past, like the atmosphere of the room, closed in about the
girl. She was strangely cheerful and uplifted; a consciousness of
approval soothed and comforted her and she recalled, as she had not
for many a day, the night of her mother&rsquo;s death&mdash;the
night when she, a girl of seventeen, had had the burden of a
mother&rsquo;s confession laid upon her young heart....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lynda&mdash;are you there, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had been a frequent, pathetic question during the month of
illness. Lynda had been summoned from school. Brace was still at
his studies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother, right here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are always&mdash;right here! Lyn, once I thought I
could not stand it, and I was going to run away&mdash;going in the
night. As I passed your door you awoke and asked for a drink of
water. I gave it, trembling lest you might notice my hat and coat;
but you did not&mdash;you only said: &lsquo;What would I do if I
woke up some night and didn&rsquo;t have a mother?&rsquo; Lyn,
dear, I went back and&mdash;stayed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda had thought her mother&rsquo;s mind wandering so she
patted the seeking hands and murmured gently to her. Then,
suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyn, when I married your father I thought I loved
him&mdash;but I loved another! I&rsquo;ve done the best I could for
you all; I never let any one know; I dared not give a sign, but I
want you&mdash;by and by&mdash;to go to&mdash;William Truedale! You
need not explain&mdash;just go; you will be my gift to him&mdash;my
last and only gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Startled and horrified, Lynda had listened, understood, and
grown old while her mother spoke....</p>
<p>Then came the night when she awoke&mdash;and found no mother!
She was never the same. She returned to school but gave up the idea
of going to college. After her graduation she made a home for the
father who now&mdash;in the light of her secret knowledge&mdash;she
comprehended for the first time. All her life she had wondered
about him. Wondered why she and Brace had not loved and honoured
him as they had their mother. His weakness, his superficiality, had
been dominated by the wife who, having accepted her lot, carried
her burden proudly to the end!</p>
<p>Brace went to college and, during his last year there, his
father died; then, confronting a future rich in debts but little
else, he and Lynda consequently turned their education to account
and were soon self-supporting, full of hope and the young joy of
life.</p>
<p>Lynda&mdash;her mother&rsquo;s secret buried deep in her loyal,
tender heart&mdash;began soon after her return from school to
cultivate old William Truedale, much to that crabbed
gentleman&rsquo;s surprise and apparent confusion. There was some
excuse for the sudden friendship, for Brace during preparatory
school and college had formed a deep and sincere attachment for
Conning Truedale and at vacation time the two boys and Lynda were
much together. To be sure the visiting was largely one-sided, as
the gloomy house of the elder Truedale offered small inducement for
sociability; but Lynda managed to wedge her way into the loneliness
and dreariness and eventually for reasons best known to herself
became the one bright thing in the old man&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>And so the years had drifted on. Besides Lynda&rsquo;s
determination to prove herself as her mother had directed, she soon
decided to set matters straight between the uncle and the nephew.
To her ardent young soul, fired with ambition and desire for
justice, it was little less than criminal that William Truedale,
crippled and confined to his chair&mdash;for he had become an
invalid soon after Lynda&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s
marriage&mdash;should misunderstand and cruelly misjudge the nephew
who, brilliantly, but under tremendous strain, was winning his way
through college on a pittance that made outside labour necessary in
order to get through. She could not understand everything, but her
mother&rsquo;s secret, her growing fondness for the old man, her
intense interest in Conning, all held her to her purpose. She,
single-handed, would right the wrong and save them all alive!</p>
<p>Then came Conning&rsquo;s breakdown and the possibility of his
death or permanent disability. The shock to all the golden hopes
was severe and it brought bitterness and resentment with it.</p>
<p>Something deep and passionate had entered into Lynda&rsquo;s
relations with Conning Truedale. For him, though no one suspected
it, she had broken her engagement to John Morrell&mdash;an
engagement into which she had drifted as so many girls do, at the
age when thought has small part in primal instinct. But Conning had
not died; he was getting well, off in his hidden place, and so,
standing in the dim workshop, Lynda kissed her mother&rsquo;s
picture and began humming a glad little tune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and have dinner with Uncle William!&rdquo;
she said&mdash;the words fitting into the
tune&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll make it up! It will be all
right.&rdquo; And so she set forth.</p>
<p>William Truedale lived on a shabby-genteel side street of a
neighbourhood that had started out to be fashionable but had been
defeated in its ambitions. It had never lost character, but it
certainly had lost lustre. The houses themselves were well built
and sternly correct. William Truedale&rsquo;s was the best in the
block and it stood with a vacant lot on either side of it. The
detachment gave it dignity and seclusion.</p>
<p>There had been a time when Truedale hoped that the woman he
loved would choose and place furniture and hangings to her taste
and his, but when that hope failed and sickness fell upon him, he
ordered only such rooms put in order as were necessary for his
restricted life. The library on the first floor was a storehouse of
splendid books and austere luxury; beyond it were bath and bedroom,
both fitted out perfectly. The long, wide hall leading to these
apartments was as empty and bare as when carpenter and painter left
it. Two servants&mdash;husband and wife&mdash;served William
Truedale, and rarely commented upon anything concerning him or
their relations to him. They probably had rooms for themselves
comfortably furnished, but in all the years Lynda Kendall had never
been anywhere in the house except in the rooms devoted to her old
friend&rsquo;s use. Sometimes she had wondered how Con fared, but
nothing was ever said on the subject and she and Brace had been, in
their visiting, limited to the downstair rooms.</p>
<p>When Lynda was ushered now into the library from the cold, outer
hall it was like finding comfort and luxury in the midst of
desolation. The opening door had not roused the man by the great
open fire. He seemed lost in a gloomy revery and Lynda had time to
note, unobserved, the tragic, pain-racked face and the pitifully
thin outlines of the figure stretched on the invalid chair and
covered by a rug of rare silver fox.</p>
<p>There were birds in gilded cages by the large south
window&mdash;mute little mites they were; they rarely if ever sang
but they were alive! There were plants, too, luxuriously growing in
pots and boxes&mdash;but not a flower on one! They existed, not
joyously, but persistently. A Russian hound, white as snow, lay
before the fire; his soft, mournful eyes were fixed upon Lynda, but
he did not stir or announce the intrusion. A cat and two kittens,
also white, were rolled like snowballs on a crimson cushion near
the hearth; Lynda wondered whether they ever played. Alone, like a
dead thing amid the still life, William Truedale,
helpless&mdash;death ever creeping nearer and nearer to his bitter
heart&mdash;passed his weary days.</p>
<p>As she stood, watching and waiting, Lynda Kendall&rsquo;s eyes
filled with quick tears. The weeks of her absence had emphasized
every tragic detail of the room and the man. He had probably missed
her terribly from his bare life, but he had made no sign, given no
call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle William!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale turned his head and fixed his deep-sunk, brilliant eyes
upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! So you&rsquo;ve thought better of it?&rdquo; was all
that he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve thought better of it. Will you let me
stay to dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off your wraps. There now! draw up the ottoman; so
long as you have a spine, rely upon it. Never lounge if you can
help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda drew the low, velvet-covered stool near the couch-chair;
the hound raised his sharp, beautiful head and nestled against her
knee. Truedale watched it&mdash;animals never came to him unless
commanded&mdash;why did they go to Lynda? Probably for the same
reason that he clung to her, watched for her and feared, with
sickening fear, that she might never come again!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose, since Con&rsquo;s death isn&rsquo;t on my
head, you felt that you could forgive me, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, something like that, Uncle William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What business is it of yours what I do with my
money&mdash;or my nephew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These two never approached each other by conventional lines.
Their absences were periods in which to store vital topics and
questions&mdash;their meetings were a series of explosive
outbursts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of my business, Uncle William, but if I could not
approve, why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Approve! Huh! Who are you that you should judge, approve,
or disapprove your elders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer to this. Lynda wanted to laugh, but feared
she might cry. The hard, indignant words belied the quivering
gladness of the voice that greeted her in every tone with its
relief and surrender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a good deal to say to you, girl. It is
well you came to-day&mdash;you might otherwise have been too late.
I&rsquo;m planning a long journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;long journey?&rdquo; she said. Through the past
years, since the dread disease had attacked Truedale, his
travelling had been confined to passing to and from bedchamber and
library in the wheelchair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you think I jest?&rdquo; There was a grim
humour in the burning eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll tell you. I am quite serious.
While I have been exiled from your attentions&mdash;chained to this
rock&rdquo; (he struck the arms of the chair like a passionate
child), &ldquo;I have reached a conclusion I have always
contemplated, more or less. Now that I have recognized that the
time will undoubtedly come when you, Con&mdash;the lot of
you&mdash;will clear out, I have decided to prove to you all that I
am not quite the dependant you think me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what can you mean, Uncle William?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a new phase and Lynda bent across the dog at her knee
and put her hand on the arm of the chair. She was frightened,
aroused. Truedale saw this and laughed a dry, mirthless laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! a chair that can roll the length of this house can
roll the distance I desire to go. Money can pay for
anything&mdash;anything! Thank God, I have money, plenty of it. It
means power&mdash;even to such a thing as I am. Power, Lynda,
power! It can snarl and unsnarl lives; it can buy favour and cause
terror. Think what I would have been without it all these years.
Think! Why, I have bargained with it; crushed with it; threatened
and beckoned with it&mdash;now I am going to play with it!
I&rsquo;m going to surprise every one and have a gala time myself.
I&rsquo;m going to set things spinning and then I&rsquo;m going on
a journey. It&rsquo;s queer&rdquo; (the sneering voice fell to a
murmur), &ldquo;all my prison-years I&rsquo;ve thought of this and
planned it; the doing of it seems quite the simplest part. I wonder
now why I have kept behind the bars when, by a little
exertion&mdash;a little indifference to opinion&mdash;I might have
broadened my horizon. But good Lord! I haven&rsquo;t wasted time.
I&rsquo;ve studied every detail; nothing has escaped me.
This&rdquo; (he touched his head&mdash;a fine, almost noble head,
covered by a wealth of white hair), &ldquo;this has been doing
double duty while these&rdquo; (he pointed to his useless legs)
&ldquo;have refused to play their part. While I felt
conscientiously responsible, I stuck to my job; but a man has a
right to a little freedom of his own!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda drew so close that her stool touched the chair. She bent
her cheek upon the shrivelled hand resting upon the arm. The
excitement and feverish banter of Truedale affected her painfully.
She reproached herself bitterly for having left him to the mercy of
his loneliness and imagination. Her interest in, her resentment
for, Conning faded before the pitiful display of feeling expressed
in every tone and word of Truedale.</p>
<p>The touch of the warm cheek against his hand stirred the man.
His eyes softened, his face twitched and, because the young eyes
were hidden, he permitted his gaze to rest reverently upon the
bowed head. She was the only thing on earth he loved&mdash;the only
thing that cut through his crust of hardness and despair and made
him human. Then, from out the unexpected, he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lynda, when did you break your engagement to John
Morrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl started, but she did not change her position. She never
lied or prevaricated to Truedale&mdash;she might keep her own
counsel, but when she spoke it was simple truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About six months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was nothing to tell, Uncle William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was the fact, wasn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, the fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;is&mdash;a long story.&rdquo; Lynda looked up,
now, and smiled the rare smile that only the stricken man
understood. Appeal, confusion, and detachment marked it. She
longed, helplessly, for sympathy and understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, long stories are welcome enough here, child;
especially after the dearth of them. Ring the bell; let&rsquo;s
have dinner. Pull down the shades and&rdquo; (Truedale gave a wide
gesture) &ldquo;put the live stock out! An early meal, a long
evening&mdash;what better could we add than a couple of long
stories?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the doing of what Truedale commanded, Lynda found a certain
relief. These visits were like grim plays, to be sure, but they
were also sacred duties. This one, after the lapse of time filled
with new and strange emotions, was a bit grimmer than usual, but it
had the effect of a tonic upon the ragged nerves of the two
actors.</p>
<p>The round table was set by the fire&mdash;it was the manservant
who attended now; silver and glass and linen were perfect, and the
simple fare carefully chosen and prepared.</p>
<p>Truedale was never so much at his ease as when he presided at
these small dinners. He ate little; he chose the rarest bits for
his guest; he talked lightly&mdash;sometimes delightfully. At such
moments Lynda realized what he must have been before love and
health failed him.</p>
<p>To-night&mdash;shut away from all else, the strain of the past
weeks ignored, the long stories deliberately pushed
aside&mdash;Truedale spoke of the books he had been reading; Lynda,
of her work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have two wonderful houses to do,&rdquo; she said,
poising a morsel of food gracefully. &ldquo;One is for a couple
recently made rich; they do not dare to move for fear of going
wrong. I have that place from garret to cellar. It&rsquo;s an awful
responsibility&mdash;but lots of fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be. Spending other people&rsquo;s money and
making them as good as new at the same time, must be rare sport.
And the other contract?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that is another matter.&rdquo; Lynda leaned back and
laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m toning up an old house. Putting false
fronts on, a bit of rouge, filling in wrinkles; in short, giving a
side-tracked old lady something to interest her. She doesn&rsquo;t
know it, but I&rsquo;m letting her do the work, and she&rsquo;s
very happy. She has a kind of rusty good taste. I&rsquo;m polishing
it without hurting her. The living room! Why, Uncle William, it is
a picture. It is a tender dream come true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are charging for that, you pirate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not have to. The dear soul is so grateful that
I&rsquo;m forced to refuse favours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lynda, ring for Thomas.&rdquo; Truedale drew his brows
close. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll smoke. It may
help me to sleep after the long stories and&mdash;when I am
alone.&rdquo; He rarely indulged in this way&mdash;tobacco excited
instead of soothed him&mdash;but the evening must have all the
clear thought possible!</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>Lynda sat again upon her ottoman&mdash;her capacity for sitting
hours without a support to her back had always been one of her
charms for William Truedale. The old man looked at her now; how
strong and fine she was! How reliant and yet&mdash;how appealing!
How she would always give and give&mdash;be used to the breaking
point&mdash;and rarely understood. Truedale understood her through
her mother!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to ask you, Lynda, why do you come here&mdash;you
of all the world? I have often wondered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I like to come, generally, Uncle
William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;other times, out of the general? You come
oftener then. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now Lynda turned her clear, dark eyes upon him. A sudden
resolve had been taken. She was going to comfort him as she never
had before, going to recompense him for the weeks just past when
she had failed him while espousing Con&rsquo;s cause. She was going
to share her secret with him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just before mother went, Uncle William, she told
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hand holding the cigar swayed&mdash;it was a very frail,
thin hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Told you&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you once&mdash;loved her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old wound ached as it was bared. Lynda meant to comfort, but
she was causing excruciating pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;told you that? And you so young! Why should she
so burden you&mdash;she of all women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;my mother loved you, Uncle William! She found
it out too late and&mdash;and after that she did her best
for&mdash;for Brace and me and&mdash;father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room seemed swaying, as all else in the universe was, at
that moment, for William Truedale. Everything that had gone to his
undoing&mdash;to the causing of his bitter loneliness and
despair&mdash;was beaten down by the words that flooded the former
darkness with almost terrifying light. For a moment or two he dared
not speak&mdash;dared not trust his voice. The shock had been
great. Then, very quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and why did she&mdash;speak at the
last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;since she could not
have come to you without dishonour&mdash;she sent me! Her
confidence has been the sacredest thing in my life and I have tried
to do as she desired. I&mdash;I have failed sadly&mdash;lately, but
try to forgive me for&mdash;my mother&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;have&rdquo;&mdash;the voice trembled
pitifully in spite of the effort Truedale made to steady
it&mdash;&ldquo;kept silence&mdash;since she went; why? Oh! youth
is so ignorant, so cruel!&rdquo; This was said more to himself than
to the girl by his knee upon whose bowed head his shrivelled hand
unconsciously rested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First it was for father that I kept the secret. He seemed
so stricken after&mdash;after he was alone. And then&mdash;since I
was trying to be to you what mother wanted me to be&mdash;it did
not seem greatly to matter. I wanted to win my way. I always meant
to tell you, and now, after these weeks of misunderstanding, I felt
you should know that there will always be a reason for me, of all
the world, to share your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see! I see!&rdquo; A great wave of emotion rose and
rose, carrying the past years of misery with it. The knowledge,
once, might have saved him, but now it had come too late. By and by
he would be able to deal with this staggering truth that had been
so suddenly hurled upon him, but not now while Katherine
Kendall&rsquo;s daughter knelt at his side!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lynda, I cannot talk to you about this. When you are
older&mdash;when life has done its best or its worst for
you&mdash;you will understand better than you do to-day; but
remember this: what you have told me has cut deep, but it has cut,
by one stroke, the hardness and bitterness from my heart. Remember
this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then with a sudden reversion to his customary manner he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now tell me about Morrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda started; the situation puzzled her. She had meant to
comfort&mdash;instead she seemed to have hurt and confused her old
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About John Morrell?&rdquo; she murmured with a rising
perplexity; &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t much to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was a long story, Lynda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow it doesn&rsquo;t seem long when you get close to
it. But surely you must see, Uncle William, that after&mdash;after
father and mother&mdash;I would naturally be a bit keener than most
girls. It would never do for me to marry the wrong man and, of
course, a girl never really knows until&mdash;she faces the
situation at close quarters. I should never have engaged myself to
John Morrell&mdash;that was the real mistake; and it was only when
he felt sure of me&mdash;that I knew! Uncle William, I must have my
own life, and John&mdash;well, he meant to have his own and mine,
too. I couldn&rsquo;t stand it! I have struggled up and conquered
little heights just as he has&mdash;just as Con and Brace have;
we&rsquo;ve all scrambled up together. It didn&rsquo;t seem quite
fair that they should&mdash;well, fly their colours from their
peaks and that I should&rdquo; (here Lynda laughed) &ldquo;cuddle
under John&rsquo;s standard. I don&rsquo;t always believe in his
standard; I don&rsquo;t approve of it. Much as I like men, I
don&rsquo;t think they are qualified to arrange, sort, fix, and
command the lives of women. If a woman thinks the abdication
justifies the gains, that&rsquo;s all right. If I had sold myself,
honourably, to John Morrell I would have kept to the agreement; I
hate and loathe women who don&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m not belittling the
romance and sentiment, Uncle William, but when all&rsquo;s told the
usual marriage is a bargain and half the women whine about holding
to it&mdash;the others play up and, if there is love enough, it
pans out pretty well&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t! You see I had
lived with father and mother&mdash;felt the lack between
them&mdash;and I saw mother&rsquo;s eyes when she&mdash;let go and
died! No! I mean to have my own life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are going to forego a woman&rsquo;s
heritage&mdash;home and children&mdash;for such a whim? Your mother
had recompenses; are you not afraid of the&mdash;future?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I respect it and do not dishonour the
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lonely man or woman&mdash;an outcast from the
ordinary&mdash;is a creature of hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; Truedale commanded sternly. &ldquo;Morrell
is a good fellow. From my prison I took care to find that out.
Brace did me practical service when he acted as sleuth before your
engagement!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda coloured and frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know about that,&rdquo; was all she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;only I&rsquo;m glad I can
feel sorry for him and angry at you. I never knew you could be a
fool, Lynda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say we all can, if we put our minds to
it&mdash;sometimes without. Well! that&rsquo;s the whole story,
Uncle William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the preface. See here, Lynda, did it ever
strike you that a woman like you doesn&rsquo;t come to such a
conclusion as you have without an experience&mdash;a contrast to go
by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I do not know what you mean, Uncle
William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you do. I have no right to probe, but I have a
right to&mdash;to help you if I can. You&rsquo;ve done much for
your mother; can you deny me the&mdash;the honour of doing
something for her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us see! You&rsquo;re just a plain girl when
all&rsquo;s said and done. You&rsquo;ve got a little more backbone
and wit than some, but your heart&rsquo;s in the same place as
other women&rsquo;s and you&rsquo;re no different in the main. You
want the sane, right things just as they do&mdash;home, children,
and security from the things women dread. A man can give a woman a
chance for her best development; she ought to recognize that
and&mdash;yes&mdash;appreciate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely!&rdquo; this came very softly from the lips
screened now by two cold shivering hands. &ldquo;A woman does
recognize it; she appreciates it, but that does not exclude her
from&mdash;choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One man&mdash;of course within limits and reason&mdash;is
as good as another when he loves a woman and makes her love him.
You certainly thought you loved Morrell. You had nothing to gain
unless you did. You probably earned as much as he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. All quite true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then something happened!&rdquo; Truedale flung his
half-smoked cigar in the fire. &ldquo;What was it,
Lynda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;was nothing&mdash;really&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was something. There was&mdash;Con!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! how&mdash;how can you?&rdquo; Lynda started back. She
meant to say &ldquo;How dare you?&rdquo;&mdash;but the drawn and
tortured face restrained her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I must, Lynda. Because I must. You know I told
you I had a story? You must bear with me and listen. Sit down again
and try to remember&mdash;I am doing this for your mother! I
repeat&mdash;there was Con. At first you took up arms for him as
Brace did; your sex instincts were not awakened. You were all good
fellows together until you drifted, blindfolded, into the trap poor
Morrell set for you. You thought I was ill-treating
Con&mdash;disregarding his best interests&mdash;starving his soul!
Oh! you poor little ignoramus; the boy never had a soul worth
mentioning until it got awakened, in self-defense, and grew its own
limit. What did you and Brace know of the past&mdash;the past that
went into Con&rsquo;s making? You were free enough with your young
condemnation and misplaced loyalty&mdash;but how about
justice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda&rsquo;s eyes were fixed upon Truedale&rsquo;s face. She
had never seen him in this mood and, while he fascinated, he
overawed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, girl, Con&rsquo;s father, my younger brother, was as
talented as Con, but he was a scamp. He had money enough to pave
the way to his own destruction. Until it was gone he spurned
me&mdash;spurned even his own genius. He married a woman as mad as
himself and then&mdash;without a qualm&mdash;tossed her aside to
die. He had no sense of responsibility&mdash;no shame. He had
temperament&mdash;a damnable one&mdash;and he drifted on it to the
end. When it was all over, I brought Conning here. Just at that
time&mdash;well, it was soon after your mother married your
father&mdash;this creeping disease fell upon me. If it hadn&rsquo;t
been for the boy I&rsquo;d have ended the whole thing then and
there, but with the burden laid upon me I couldn&rsquo;t slip out.
It has been a kind of race ever since&mdash;this menace mounting
higher and higher and the making of Con keeping pace. I swore that
if he had talent it must prove itself against hardship, not in
luxury. I made life difficult in order to toughen and inspire. I
never meant to kill&mdash;you must do me that justice. Only you
see, chained here, I couldn&rsquo;t follow close enough, and Con
had pride, thank God! and he thought he had hate&mdash;but he
hasn&rsquo;t or he&rsquo;d have starved rather than accept what I
offered. In his heart he&mdash;well, let us say&mdash;respects me
to a certain extent. I saw him widening the space between himself
and his inheritance&mdash;and it has helped me live; you saw him
making a man of himself and it became more absorbing than the
opportunity of annexing yourself to a man already made. Oh, I have
seen it all and it has helped me in my plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your&mdash;plan?&rdquo; The question was a feeble attempt
to grapple with a situation growing too big and strong. &ldquo;Your
plan&mdash;what is your plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lynda, I have made my will! Sitting apart and looking on,
the doing of this has been the one great excitement of my life.
Through the years I have believed I was doing it alone; now I see
your mother&rsquo;s guiding hand has led me on; I want you to
believe this as&mdash;I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I will try, Uncle William.&rdquo; Lynda no longer
struggled against that which she could not understand. She felt it
must have its way with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This house,&rdquo; Truedale was saying, &ldquo;was meant
for your mother. I left it bare and ready for her taste and choice.
After&mdash;I go, I want you to fit it out for her&mdash;and me!
You must do it at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; Lynda put up a protesting hand, but
Truedale smiled her into silence and went on: &ldquo;I may let you
begin to-morrow and not wait! You must fill the bare
corners&mdash;spare no expense. You and I will be quite reckless; I
want this place to be a&mdash;home at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now Lynda&rsquo;s eyes were shining&mdash;her rare tears
blinded her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have always tried indirectly, Lynda, to secure
Con&rsquo;s greatest good; you have done it! I mean to leave him a
legacy of three thousand a year. That will enable him to let up on
himself and develop the talent you think he has. I have seen to it
that the two faithful souls who have served me here shall never
know want. There will be money, and plenty of it, for you to carry
out my wishes regarding this house, should&mdash;well&mdash;should
anything happen to me! After these details are attended to, my
fortune, rather a cumbersome one, goes to&mdash;Dr. McPherson, my
old and valued friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda started violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To&mdash;to Dr. McPherson?&rdquo; she gasped, every
desire for Conning up in arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! there! do not get so excited, Lynda. It is only
for&mdash;three years. McPherson and I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will go to Conning&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If what?&rdquo; Lynda was afraid now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&mdash;marries you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! this is beyond endurance! How could you be so cruel,
Uncle William?&rdquo; The hot, passionate tears were burning the
indignant face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not know. The years will test and prove
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall know! If you thought best to do this thing,
why have you told me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been hours when I myself did not know why; I
understand to-night. Your mother led me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother could never have hurt me so. Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must trust&mdash;her and me, Lynda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose&mdash;oh! suppose&mdash;Con does not ... Oh! this
is degrading!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the fortune will&mdash;be yours. McPherson and I
have worked this out&mdash;most carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine! Mine! Why&rdquo;&mdash;and here Lynda flung her
head back and laughed relievedly&mdash;&ldquo;I refuse absolutely
to accept it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case it goes&mdash;to charities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hush fell in the room. Baffled and angry, Lynda dared not
trust herself to speak and Truedale sank back wearily. Then came a
rattle of wheels in the quiet street&mdash;a toot of a taxi
horn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thomas has not forgotten to provide for your home trip;
but the man can wait. The night is mild&rdquo;&mdash;Truedale spoke
gently&mdash;&ldquo;and you and I are rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda did not seem to hear. Her thoughts were rushing wildly
over the path set for her by her old friend&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conning would not know!&rdquo; she grasped and held to
that; &ldquo;he would be able to act independently. At first it had
seemed impossible. Her knowledge could affect no one but herself!
If&rdquo;&mdash;and here Lynda breathed faster&mdash;&ldquo;if
Conning should want her enough to ask her to share his life that
the three thousand dollars made possible, why then the happiness of
bringing his own to him would be hers!&mdash;hers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the opposite side of the picture held her. &ldquo;But
suppose he did <i>not</i> want her&mdash;in that way? Then she, his
friend&mdash;the one who, in all the world, loved him the
best&mdash;would profit by it; she would be a wealthy woman, for
her mother&rsquo;s sake or&rdquo;&mdash;the alternative staggered
her&mdash;&ldquo;she could let everything slip, everything and bear
the consequences!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point she turned to Truedale and asked pitifully
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! why, why did you do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no anger or rebellion in the words, but a pathos that
caused the old man to close his eyes against the pleading in the
uplifted face. It was the one thing he could not stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time will prove, child; time will prove. I could not make
you understand; your mother might have&mdash;I could not. But time
will show. Time is a strange revealer. All my life I have been
working in darkness until&mdash;now! I should have trusted
more&mdash;you must learn from me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, do not keep the man waiting longer. I
wonder&mdash;do not do it unless you want to, or think it
right&mdash;but I wonder if you could kiss me good-bye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda rose and, tear-blinded, bent over and kissed
him&mdash;kissed him twice, once for her mother!&mdash;and she felt
that he understood. She had never touched her lips to his before,
and it seemed a strange ceremony.</p>
<p>An hour later Truedale called for Thomas and was wheeled to his
bedroom and helped to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said to the man, &ldquo;you had better
put those drops on the stand. If I cannot sleep&mdash;&rdquo;
Thomas smiled and obeyed. There had been a time when he feared that
small, dark bottle, but not now! He believed too sincerely in his
master&rsquo;s strength of character. Having the medicine near
might, by suggestion, help calm the restlessness, but it had never
been resorted to, so Thomas smiled as he turned away with a
cheery:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir; but there will be no need, I
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Thomas. Raise the shade, please. It&rsquo;s a
splendid night, isn&rsquo;t it? If they should build on that rear
lot I could not see the moon so well. I may decide to buy that
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Thomas had gone and he was alone at last, Truedale heaved a
heavy sigh. It seemed to relieve the restraint under which he had
been labouring for weeks.</p>
<p>All his life the possibility of escape from his bondage had made
the bondage less unendurable. It was like knowing of a secret
passage from his prison house&mdash;an exit dark and attended by
doubts and fears, but nevertheless a sure passage to freedom. It
had seemed, in the past, a cowardly thing to avail himself of his
knowledge&mdash;it was like going with his debts unpaid. But now,
in the bright, moonlit room it no longer appeared so. He had
finished his task, had ended the bungling, and had heard a clear
call ringing with commendation and approval. There was nothing to
hold him back!</p>
<p>Over in the cabinet by the window were a photograph and a few
letters; Truedale turned toward them and wondered if Lynda, instead
of his old friend McPherson, would find them? He wished he had
spoken&mdash;but after all, he could not wait. He had definitely
decided to take the journey! But he spoke softly as if to a
Presence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so&mdash;you played a part? Poor girl! how
well&mdash;you played it! And you&mdash;suffered&mdash;oh! my
God&mdash;and I never did you the justice of understanding. And you
left your girl&mdash;to me&mdash;I have tried not to fail you
there, Katherine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Truedale reached for the bottle. He took a swallow of the
contents and waited! Presently he took another and a thrill of
exhilaration stirred his sluggish blood. Weakly, gropingly, he
stretched his benumbed hand out again; he was well on his way now.
The long journey was begun in the moonlight and, strange to say, it
did not grow dark, nor did he seem to be alone. This surprised him
vaguely, he had always expected it would be so different!</p>
<p>And by and by one face alone confronted him&mdash;it was
brighter than the moonlit way. It smiled understandingly&mdash;it,
too, had faced the broad highway&mdash;it could afford to
smile.</p>
<p>Once more the heavy, dead-cold hand moved toward the stand
beside the bed, but it fell nerveless ere it reached what it
sought.</p>
<p>The escape had been achieved!</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>The days passed and, unfettered, Jim White remained in the deep
woods. After Nella-Rose&rsquo;s disturbing but thrilling advent,
Truedale rebounded sharply and, alone in his cabin, brought himself
to terms. By a rigid arraignment he relegated, or thought he had
relegated, the whole matter to the realm of things he should not
have permitted, but which had done no real harm. He brought out the
heavy book on philosophy and endeavoured to study. After a few
hours he even resorted to the wet towel, thinking that suggestion
might assist him, but Nella-Rose persistently and impishly got
between his eyes and the pages and flouted philosophy by the magic
of her superstition and bewitching charm.</p>
<p>Then Truedale attacked his play, viciously, commandingly. This
was more successful. He reconstructed his plot somewhat&mdash;he
let Nella-Rose in! Curbed and somewhat re-modelled, she
materialized and, while he dealt strictly with her, writing was
possible.</p>
<p>So the first day and night passed. On the second day
Truedale&rsquo;s new strength demanded exercise and recreation. He
couldn&rsquo;t be expected to lock himself in until White returned
to chaperone him. After all, there was no need of being a fool. So
he packed a gunny sack with food and a book or two, and sallied
forth, after providing generously for the live stock and calling
the dogs after him.</p>
<p>But Truedale was unaware of what was going on about him. Pine
Cone Settlement had, since the trap episode, been tense and
waiting. Not many things occurred in the mountains and when they
did they were made the most of. With significant silence the
friends and foes of Burke Lawson were holding themselves in check
until he returned to his old haunts; then there would be
considerable shooting&mdash;not necessarily fatal, a midnight raid
or two, a general rumpus, and eventually, a truce.</p>
<p>All this Jim White knew, and it was the propelling factor that
had sent him to the deep woods. His sentiments conflicted with
duty. Guilty as Lawson was, the sheriff liked him better than he
did Martin and he meant, should he come across Burke in &ldquo;the
sticks,&rdquo; to take him off for a bear hunt and some good
advice. Thus he would justify his conscience and legal duties. But
White, strange to say, was as ignorant as Truedale was of an
element that had entered into conditions. It had never occurred to
Jim to announce or explain his visitor&rsquo;s arrival. To Pine
Cone a &ldquo;furriner&rdquo; aroused at best but a superficial
interest and, since Truedale had arrived, unseen, at night, why
mention him to a community that could not possibly have anything in
common with him? So it was that Greyson and a few others, noting
Truedale at a distance and losing sight of him at once, concluded
that he was Burke, back and in hiding; and a growing but stealthy
excitement was in the air. He was supposed by both factions to be
with the sheriff, and feeling ran high. In the final estimate,
could White have known it, he himself held no small part!</p>
<p>Beloved and hated, Lawson divided the community for and against
himself about equally. There were those who defended and swore they
would kill any who harmed the young outlaw&mdash;he was of the
jovial, dare-devil type and as loyal to his friends as he was
unyielding to his foes. Others declared that the desperado must be
&ldquo;finished&rdquo;; the trap disagreement was but the last of a
long list of crimes; it was time to put a quietus on one who
refused to fall into line&mdash;who called the sheriff his friend
and had been known to hobnob with revenue men! That, perhaps, was
the blackest deed to be attributed to any native.</p>
<p>So all Pine Cone was on the war path and Truedale, heedless and
unaware, took his air and exercise at his peril.</p>
<p>The men of the hills had a clear case now, since Peter Greyson
had given his evidence, which, by the way, became more conclusive
hour by hour as imagination, intoxication, and the delight of
finding himself important, grew upon Greyson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim told me,&rdquo; Peter had confided to Jed Martin,
&ldquo;that he was going to get a posse from way-back and round
Lawson up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was wholly false. White never took any one into his
business secrets, least of all Greyson for whom he had deep
contempt. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t call that clean to us-all, Jed.
We don&rsquo;t want strangers to catch Burke; we don&rsquo;t want
them to&mdash;to string him up or shoot him full of holes; what
we-all want is to force White to hand him over to justice, give him
a fair trial, and then send him to one of them prison traps to eat
his soul out behind bars. Jed&mdash;just you shut your eyes and
<i>see</i> Burke Lawson behind bars&mdash;eating sop from a pan,
drinking prison water&mdash;just you call that picture
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jed endeavoured to do so and it grew upon his imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-all wants to trail him,&rdquo; Greyson continued,
&ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want to give him a free passage to
Kingdom-Come by rope or shot&mdash;we-all want prison for Lawson,
prison!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jed was the one most concerned, this edict went abroad by
mountain wireless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch him alive!&rdquo; Friend and foe were alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when all&rsquo;s fixed and done&mdash;when
Burke&rsquo;s trapped,&rdquo; Greyson said, &ldquo;what you going
to do&mdash;for me, Jed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a startling, new development.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t reckon yo&rsquo; war doin&rsquo;
this&mdash;fur pay!&rdquo; Jed faltered. Then Greyson came
forth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No pay, Jed. Gawd knows I do my duty as I see it. But
being keen about duty, I see more than one duty. When you catch and
cage Lawson, Jed, I want to be something closer to you than a
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Closer than&mdash;&rdquo; Jed gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And duty drives me to confess to you, Jed, that the
happiness of a lady is at stake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jed merely gaped now. Visions of Nella-Rose made him giddy and
speechless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day you put Lawson in jail, Jed, that day I&rsquo;ll
give you the hand of my daughter. She loves you; she has confessed!
You shall come here and share&mdash;everything! The hour that Burke
is convicted&mdash;Marg is yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marg!&rdquo; The word came on a gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word!&rdquo; Greyson waved his hand in a princely
way&mdash;this gesture was an heirloom from his ancestry. &ldquo;I
understand your feelings&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen what has been going
on&mdash;but naturally I want my daughter to marry one worthy of
her. You shall have my Marg when you have proven yourself!
I&rsquo;ve misjudged you, Jed, but this will wipe away old
scores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a sickening sense of being absorbed, Jed sank into black
silence. If Marg wanted him and old Greyson was helping her, there
was no hope! Blood and desire would conquer every time; every
mountaineer recognized that!</p>
<p>And so things were seething under a surface of deadly calm, when
Truedale, believing that he had himself well in control, packed his
gunny sack and started forth for a long tramp. He had no particular
destination in mind&mdash;in fact, the soft, dreamy autumn day
lulled him to mental inertia&mdash;he simply went along, but he
went as directly toward the rhododendron slick as though he had
long planned his actions. However, it was late afternoon before he
came upon Nella-Rose.</p>
<p>On the instant he realized that he had been searching for her
all day. His stern standards crumbled and became dry dust. One
might as well apply standards to flickering sunlight or to swirling
trifles of mountain mist as to Nella-Rose. She came upon him gaily;
the dogs had discovered her on one of their ventures and were now
quietly accompanying her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been looking for you&mdash;all
day!&rdquo; Truedale admitted, with truth but indiscretion. And
then he noted, as he had before, the strange impression the girl
gave of having been blown upon the scene. The pretty, soft hair
resting on the cheek in a bewildering curve; the large, dreamy eyes
and black lashes; the close clinging of her shabby costume, as if
wrapped about her slim body by the playful gale that had wafted her
along; all held part in the illusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to&mdash;to lead Marg to Devil-may-come Hollow.
She&rsquo;s hunting there now!&rdquo; Nella-Rose&rsquo;s white
teeth showed in a mischievous smile. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re right safe
with Marg down there, scurrying around. Come, I know a sunny
place&mdash;I want to tell you about Marg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her childish appropriation of him completed Truedale&rsquo;s
surrender. The absolute lack of self-consciousness drove the last
remnant of caution away. They found the sunny spot&mdash;it was
like a dimple in a hill that had caught the warmth and brightness
and held them always to the exclusion of shadows. It almost seemed
that night could never conquer the nook.</p>
<p>And while they rested there, Nella-Rose told him of the belief
of the natives that he was the refugee Lawson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Marg would give you up
like&mdash;er&mdash;this&rdquo; (Nella-Rose puffed an imaginary
trifle away with her pretty pursed lips). &ldquo;She trailed after
me all day&mdash;she lost me in a place where hiding&rsquo;s
good&mdash;and there I left her! She&rsquo;ll tell Jed Martin this
evening when she gets back. Marg is scenting Burke for Jed and his
kind to catch&mdash;that&rsquo;s her way and Jed&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
Stinging contempt rang in the girl&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not your way I bet, Nella-Rose.&rdquo; The fun, not
the danger, of the situation struck Truedale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&mdash;I&rsquo;d do it all myself! I&rsquo;d either
warn him and have done with it, or I&rsquo;d stand by
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I like the misunderstanding about
me,&rdquo; Truedale half playfully remarked, &ldquo;they may shoot
me in the back before they find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you&rdquo; (and here Nella-Rose&rsquo;s face fell into
serious, dangerously sweet, lines), &ldquo;do you reckon I would
leave you to them-all if there was that danger? They don&rsquo;t
aim to shoot or string Burke up; they reckon they&rsquo;ll take him
alive and&mdash;get him locked up in jail
to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Nella-Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Die of longing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what would happen to Burke Lawson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded. Then the entrancing mischief returned to her
eyes and she became a child once more&mdash;a creature so
infinitely young that Truedale seemed grandfatherly by
comparison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see how mighty funny it will be to lead
them and let them follow on and then some day&mdash;they&rsquo;ll
plump right up on you and find out! Godda&rsquo;mighty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Irresponsible mirth swayed the girl to and fro. She laughed,
silently, until the tears stood in the clear eyes. Truedale caught
the spirit of her mood and laughed with her. The picture she
portrayed of setting jealousy, malice, and stupidity upon the wrong
trail was very funny, but suddenly he paused and said
seriously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in the meantime this Burke Lawson may return; you may
be the death of him with your pranks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nella-Rose shook her head. &ldquo;I would know!&rdquo; she
declared confidently. &ldquo;I know everything that&rsquo;s going
on in the hills. Burke would let me know&mdash;first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like melodrama,&rdquo; Truedale murmured half
to himself. By some trick of fancy he seemed to be looking on as
Brace Kendall might have. The thought brought him to bay. What
would good old Brace do in the present situation?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is melodrama?&rdquo; Nella-Rose never let a new word
or suggestion escape her. She was as keen as she was dramatic and
mischievous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be hard to make you understand&mdash;but see
here&rdquo;&mdash;Truedale drew the gunny sack to
him&mdash;&ldquo;I bet you&rsquo;re hungry!&rdquo; He deliberately
put Brace from his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I am.&rdquo; The lovely eyes were fixed upon the
hand that was bringing forth the choicest morsels of the food
prepared early that morning. As he laid the little feast before
her, Truedale acknowledged that, in a vague way, he had been saving
the morsels for Nella-Rose even while he had fed, earlier, upon
coarser fare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about giving you a chicken
wing!&rdquo; he said playfully. &ldquo;You look as if you were
about to fly away as it is&mdash;but unfortunately I&rsquo;ve eaten
both legs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! please&rdquo;&mdash;Nella-Rose reached across the
narrow space separating them, she was pleading
prettily&mdash;&ldquo;I just naturally admire wings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet you do! Well, eat plenty of bread with them. And
see here, Nella-Rose, while you are eating I&rsquo;m going to read
a story to you. It is the sort of thing that we call
melodrama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; This through the dainty nibbling of the
coveted wing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right fond of stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet now!&rdquo; commanded Truedale and he began
the spirited tale of love and high adventure that, like the
tidbits, he knew he had brought for Nella-Rose!</p>
<p>The warm autumn sun fell upon them for a full hour, then it
shifted and the chill of the approaching evening warned the reader
of the flight of time. He stopped suddenly to find that his
companion had long since forgotten her hunger and food. Across the
d&eacute;bris she bent, absorbed and tense. Her hands were clasped
close&mdash;cold, little hands they were&mdash;and her big eyes
were strained and wonder-filled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that&mdash;all?&rdquo; she asked, hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, child, there&rsquo;s more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late! We must get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I must know the rest! Why, don&rsquo;t you see,
you know how it turns out; I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. I want it here with the warm sun and the pines
and your&mdash;yourself making it real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand, Nella-Rose!&rdquo; But as he spoke
Truedale began to understand and it gave him an uneasy moment. He
knew what he ought to do, but knew that he was not going to do it!
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to come again and hear the rest,&rdquo; was
what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? Why&rdquo;&mdash;and here the shadowy eyes took on
the woman-look, the look that warned and lured the man near
her&mdash;&ldquo;I did not know it ever came like
that&mdash;really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Nella-Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;love. They-all knew it&mdash;and took it. It
was just like it was something all by itself. That&rsquo;s not the
sort us-all have. Does it only come that&mdash;er&mdash;way in
mel&mdash;melerdrammer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, little girl. It comes that way in real life when
hearts are big enough and strong enough to bear it.&rdquo; Truedale
watched the effect of his words upon the strange, young face before
him. They forced their way through her ignorance and untrained
yearning for love and admiration. It was a perilous moment, for
conscience, on Truedale&rsquo;s part, seemed drugged and sleeping
and Nella-Rose was awakening to that which she had never known
before. Gone, for her, were caprice and mischief; she seemed about
to see and hear some wonderful thing that eluded but called her
on.</p>
<p>And after that first day they met often. &ldquo;Happened upon
each other&rdquo; was the way Truedale put it. It seemed very
natural. The picturesque spots appealed to them both. There was
reading, too&mdash;carefully selected bits. It was intensely
interesting to lead the untrained mind into bewildering
mazes&mdash;to watch surprise, wonder, and perplexity merge into
understanding and enjoyment. Truedale experienced the satisfaction
of seeing that, for the first time in his life, he was a great
power. The thought set his brain whirling a bit, but it made him
seriously humble as well.</p>
<p>Gradually his doubts and introspections became more definite; he
lived day by day, hour by hour; while Jim White tarried, Nella-Rose
remained; and the past&mdash;Truedale&rsquo;s past&mdash;faded
almost from sight. He could hardly realize, when thinking of it
afterward, where and how he decided to cut loose from his past, and
all it meant, and accept a future almost ludicrously different from
anything he had contemplated.</p>
<p>One day a reference to Burke Lawson was made and, instead of
letting it pass as heretofore, he asked suddenly of Nella-Rose:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl flushed and turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burke?&mdash;oh, Burke
isn&rsquo;t&mdash;anything&mdash;now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he ever&mdash;anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon he wasn&rsquo;t; I <i>know</i> he
wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, like a flash, Truedale believed he understood what had
happened. This simple girl meant more to him than anything
else&mdash;more than the past and what it held! A baser man would
not have been greatly disturbed by this knowledge; a man with more
experience and background would have understood it and known that
it was a phase that must be dealt with sternly and
uncompromisingly, but that it was merely a phase and as such bound
to pass. Not so Truedale. He was stirred to the roots of his being;
every experience was to him a concrete fact and, consequently,
momentous. In order to keep pure the emotions that overpowered him
at times, he must renounce all that separated him from Nella-Rose
and reconstruct his life; or&mdash;he must let <i>her</i> go!</p>
<p>Once Truedale began to reason this out, once he saw
Nella-Rose&rsquo;s dependence upon him&mdash;her trust and
happiness&mdash;he capitulated and permitted his imagination to
picture and colour the time on ahead. He refused to turn a backward
glance.</p>
<p>Of course all this was not achieved without struggle and
foreboding; but he saw no way to hold what once was dear, without
dishonour to that which now was dearer; and he&mdash;let go!</p>
<p>This determined, he strenuously began to prepare himself for the
change. Day by day he watched Nella-Rose with new and far-seeing
interest&mdash;not always with love and passion-blinded eyes. He
felt that she could, with his devotion and training, develop into a
rarely sweet and fine woman. He was not always a fool in his
madness; at times he was wonderfully clear-sighted. He meant to
return home, when once his health was restored, and take the
Kendalls into his confidence; but the thought of Lynda gave him a
bad moment now and then. He could not easily depose her from the
most sacred memories of his life, but gradually he grew to believe
that her relations to him were&mdash;had always
been&mdash;platonic; and that she, in the new scheme, would play no
small part in his life and Nella-Rose&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>There would be years of self-denial and labour and then, by and
by, success would be achieved. He would take his finished work, and
in this he included Nella-Rose, back to his old haunts and prove
his wisdom and good fortune. In short, Truedale was
love-mad&mdash;ready to fling everything to the ruthless winds of
passion. He blindly called things by wrong names and steered
straight for the rocks.</p>
<p>He meant well, as God knew; indeed all the religious elements,
hitherto unsuspected in him, came to the fore now. Conventions were
absurd when applied to present conditions, but, once having
accepted the inevitable, the way was divinely radiant. He meant to
pay the price for what he yearned after. He had no other
intention.</p>
<p>Now that he was resigned to letting the past go, he could afford
to revel in the joys of the present with a glad sense of
responsibility for the future.</p>
<p>Presently his course seemed so natural that he wondered he had
ever questioned it. More and more men with a vision&mdash;and
Truedale devoutly believed he had the vision&mdash;were recognizing
the absurdity of old ideals.</p>
<p>Back to the soil meant more than the physical; it meant back to
the primitive, the simple, the real. The artificial exactions of
society must be spurned if a new and higher morality were to be
established.</p>
<p>If Truedale in this state of mind had once seen the actual
danger, all might have been well; but he had swung out of his
orbit.</p>
<p>At this juncture Nella-Rose was puzzling her family to the
extent of keeping her father phenomenally sober and driving Marg to
the verge of nerve exhaustion.</p>
<p>The girl had, to put it in Greyson&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;grown
up over night.&rdquo; She was dazzling and recalled a past that
struck deep in the father&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>There had been a time when Peter Greyson, a mere boy, to be
sure&mdash;and before the cruel war had wrecked the fortunes of his
family&mdash;had been surrounded by such women as Nella-Rose now
suggested. Women with dancing eyes and soft, white hands. Women
born and bred for love and homage, who demanded their privileges
with charm and beauty. There had been one fascinating woman, a
great-aunt of Nella-Rose&rsquo;s, who had imperilled the family
honour by taking her heritage of worship with a high hand.
Disregarding the rights of another, she boldly rode off with the
man of her choice and left the reconstruction of her reputation to
her kith and kin who roused instantly to action and lied, like
ladies and gentlemen, when truth was impossible. Eventually they so
toned down and polished the deed of the little social highwaywoman
as to pass her on in the family history with an escutcheon shadowed
only, rather than smirched.</p>
<p>Nella-Rose, now that her father considered, was dangerously like
her picturesque ancestress! The thought kept Peter from the still,
back in the woods, for many a day. He, poor down-at-heel fellow,
was as ready as any man of his line to protect women, especially
his own, but he was sorely perplexed now.</p>
<p>Was it Burke Lawson who, from his hiding place, was throwing a
glamour over Nella-Rose?</p>
<p>Then Peter grew ugly. The protection of women was one thing;
ridding the community of an outlaw was another. Men knew how to
deal with such matters and Greyson believed himself to be very much
of a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nella-Rose,&rdquo; he said one day as he smoked
reflectively and listened to his younger daughter singing a camp
meeting hymn in a peculiarly sweet little voice, &ldquo;when my
ship comes in, honey, I&rsquo;m going to buy you a harp. A gold
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have a pink frock, father, and a real
hat; I just naturally hate sunbonnets! I&rsquo;d favour a feather
on my hat&mdash;flowers fade right easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But harps is mighty elegant, Nella-Rose. Time was when
your&mdash;aunts and&mdash;and grandmothers took to harps like they
was their daily nourishment. Don&rsquo;t you ever forget that,
Nella-Rose. Harps in families mean <i>blood</i>, and blood
don&rsquo;t run out if you&rsquo;re careful of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nella-Rose laughed, but Marg, in the wash-house beyond, listened
and&mdash;hated!</p>
<p>No one connected <i>her</i> with harps or blood, but she held,
in her sullen heart and soul, the true elements of all that had
gone into the making of the best Greysons. And as the winter
advanced, Marg, worn in mind and body, was brought face to face
with stern reality. Autumn was gone&mdash;though the languorous
hours belied it. She must prepare. So she gathered her
forces&mdash;her garden products that could be exchanged for
necessities; the pork; the wool; all, all that could be spared, she
must set in circulation. So she counted three dozen eggs and
weighed ten pounds of pork and called Nella-Rose, who was driving
her mad by singing and romping outside the kitchen door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;Nella-Rose!&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;are you
plumb crazy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nella-Rose became demure at once and presented herself at the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I look it?&rdquo; she said, turning her wonderful
little face up for inspection. Something in the words and in the
appealing beauty made Marg quiver. Had happiness and justice been
meted out to Marg Greyson she would have been the tenderest of
sisters to Nella-Rose. Several years lay between them; the younger
girl was encroaching upon the diminishing rights of the older. The
struggle between them was as old as life itself, but it could not
kill utterly what should have existed ardently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got to tote these things&rdquo;&mdash;Marg held forth
the basket&mdash;&ldquo;down to the Centre for trade, and you can
fetch back the lil&rsquo; things like pepper, salt, and sugar. Tell
Cal Merrivale to fetch the rest and bargain for what I&rsquo;ve got
ready here, when he drives by. If you start now you can be back by
sundown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Marg&rsquo;s surprise, Nella-Rose offered no protest to the
seven-mile walk, nor to the heavy load. She promptly pulled her
sunbonnet to the proper angle on her head and gripped the
basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you goin&rsquo; to eat first?&rdquo; asked
Marg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Put in a bite; I&rsquo;ll eat it by the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Centre was in the opposite direction from the Hollow, as
seven miles going and seven miles coming would subdue the spirits
and energy even of Nella-Rose, Marg was perplexed. However, she
prepared food, tucked it in the basket, and even went so far as to
pin her sister&rsquo;s shawl closely under her chin. Then she
watched the slim, straight figure depart&mdash;still puzzled but at
peace for the day, at least.</p>
<p>Nella-Rose, however, was plotting an attack upon Truedale quite
out of the common. By unspoken consent he and she had agreed that
their meetings should be in the open. Jim White might return at
anytime and neither of them wanted at first to include him in the
bewildering drama of their lives. For different reasons they knew
that Jim&rsquo;s cold understanding of duty would shatter the
sacred security that was all theirs. Truedale meant to confide
everything to White upon his return&mdash;meant to rely upon him in
the reconstruction of his life; but he knew nothing could be so
fatal to the future as any conflict at the present with the
sheriff&rsquo;s strict ideas of conduct. As for Nella-Rose, she had
reason to fear White&rsquo;s power as woman-hater and upholder of
law and order. She simply eliminated Jim and, in order to do this,
she must keep him in the dark.</p>
<p>Early that morning she had looked, as she did every day, from
the hill behind the house and she had seen but one thin curl of
smoke from the clearing! If White had not returned the night before
the chances were that he would make another day of it! Nella-Rose
often wondered why others did not note the tell-tale smoke&mdash;a
clue which often played a vital part in the news of the hills. Only
because thoughts were focussed on the Hollow and on White&rsquo;s
absence, was Truedale secure in his privacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hurry mighty fast to the Centre,&rdquo;
Nella-Rose concluded, after escaping from Marg&rsquo;s disturbed
gaze, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll hide the things by the big road and
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;go to his cabin. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
surprise him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale had told her the day before, in a moment of caution,
that he would have to work hard for a time in order to make ready
for White&rsquo;s return. The fact was he had now got to that point
in his story when he longed for Jim as he might have longed for
safety on a troubled sea. With Jim back and fully
informed&mdash;everything on ahead would be safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll surprise him!&rdquo; murmured Nella-Rose, with
the dimples in full play at the corners of her mouth; &ldquo;old
Jim White can&rsquo;t keep me away. I&rsquo;ll watch
out&mdash;it&rsquo;s just for a minute; I&rsquo;ll be back by
sundown; it will be only to say &lsquo;how-de?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something argued with the girl as she ran on&mdash;something
quite new and uncontrolled. Heretofore no law but that of the wilds
had entered into her calculations. To get what she could of
happiness and life&mdash;to make as little fuss as
possible&mdash;that had been her code; but now, the same restraint
that had held Marg from going to the Hollow awhile back, when she
thought that, with night, Burke Lawson might disclose his
whereabouts, held Nella-Rose! So insistent was the rising argument
that it angered the girl. &ldquo;Why? Why?&rdquo; her longings and
desires cried. &ldquo;Because! Because!&rdquo; was the stern
response, and the <i>woman</i> in Nella-Rose thrilled and throbbed
and trembled, while the girlish spirit pleaded for the excitement
of joy and sweetness that was making the grim stretches of her
narrow existence radiant and full of meaning.</p>
<p>On she went doggedly. The dimples disappeared; the mouth fell
into the pathetic, drooping lines that by and by, unless something
saved Nella-Rose, would become permanent and mark her as a
hill-woman&mdash;one to whom soul visions were denied.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>Wisdom had all but conquered Nella-Rose&rsquo;s folly when she
came in sight of Calvin Merrivale&rsquo;s store. But&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;perhaps the girl&rsquo;s story had been written long
since, and she was not entirely free. Be that as it may, she
paused, for no reason whatever as far as she could tell, and
carefully took one dozen eggs from the basket and hid them under
some bushes by the road! Having done this she went forward so
blithely and lightly that one might have thought her load had been
considerably eased. She appeared before Calvin Merrivale,
presently, like a refreshing apparition from vacancy. It was high
noon and Merrivale was dozing in a chair by the rusty stove, in
which a fire, prepared against the evening chill, was already
burning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How-de, Mister Merrivale?&rdquo; Calvin sprang to his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t lil&rsquo; Nella-Rose. How&rsquo;se
you-all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right smart. I&rsquo;ve brought you three dozen eggs and
ten pounds of pork.&rdquo; Nella-Rose almost said
po&rsquo;k&mdash;not quite! &ldquo;And you must be mighty generous
with me when you weigh out&mdash;let me see!&mdash;oh, yes, pepper,
salt, and sugar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay a siftin&rsquo; more in the scale,
Nella-Rose, on &rsquo;count o&rsquo; yo&rsquo; enjoyin&rsquo; ways.
But I can&rsquo;t make this out&rdquo;&mdash;he was counting the
eggs&mdash;&ldquo;yo&rsquo; said three dozen aigs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three dozen, and ten pounds of pork!&rdquo; This very
firmly.</p>
<p>Merrivale counted again and as he did so Nella-Rose remembered!
The red came to her face&mdash;the tears to her ashamed eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she said softly, going close to the old man.
&ldquo;I forgot. I took one dozen out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merrivale stood and looked at her and then, what he thought was
understanding, came to his assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who fo&rsquo;, Nella-Rose, who fo&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no reply to this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; needn&rsquo;t be afraid to open yo&rsquo; mind
ter me, Nella-Rose. Keeping sto&rsquo; is a mighty help in
gettin&rsquo; an all-around knowin&rsquo; o&rsquo; things. Folks
jest naterally come here an&rsquo; talk an&rsquo; jest naterally I
listen, an&rsquo; &rsquo;twixt Jim White, the sheriff, an&rsquo;
old Merrivale, there ain&rsquo;t much choosin&rsquo;, jedgmatically
speakin&rsquo;. I know White&rsquo;s off an&rsquo; plannin&rsquo;
ter round up Burke Lawson from behind, as it war. T&rsquo;warnt so
in my day, lil&rsquo; Nella-Rose. When we-uns had a reckonin
comin&rsquo;, we naterally went out an&rsquo; shot our man; but
these torn-down scoundrels like Jed Martin an&rsquo; his kind they
trap &rsquo;em an&rsquo; send &rsquo;em to worse&rsquo;n hell.
Las&rsquo; night&rdquo;&mdash;and here Merrivale bent close to
Nella-Rose&mdash;&ldquo;my hen coop was &rsquo;tarnally gone
through, an&rsquo; a bag o&rsquo; taters lifted. I ain&rsquo;t
makin&rsquo; no cry-out. I ain&rsquo;t forgot the year o&rsquo; the
fever an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;well, yo&rsquo; know
who&mdash;took care o&rsquo; me day an&rsquo; night till I saw
faces an&rsquo; knew &rsquo;em! What&rsquo;s a matter o&rsquo; a
hen o&rsquo; two an&rsquo; a sack o&rsquo; taters when lined up
agin that fever spell? I tell yo&rsquo;, Nella-Rose, if
<i>yo&rsquo;</i> say thar war three dozen aigs, thar <i>war</i>
three dozen aigs, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll bargain
accordin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now the dimples came slowly to the relieved face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll bring you an extra dozen
right soon, Mister Merrivale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; ter flex my soul &rsquo;bout
that, Nella-Rose. Aigs is aigs, but human nater is human nater;
an&rsquo; keepin&rsquo; a store widens yo&rsquo; stretch o&rsquo;
vision. Now, watch out, lil&rsquo; girl, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t take
too much fo&rsquo; granted. When a gun goes off yo&rsquo; hear it;
but when skunks trail, yo&rsquo; don&rsquo;t get no sign,
&rsquo;less it&rsquo;s a smell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nella-Rose took her packages, smiled her thanks, and ran on. She
ate her lunch by the bushes where the eggs lay hidden, then
depositing in the safe shelter the home bundles Merrivale had so
generously weighed, she put the eggs in the basket, packed with
autumn leaves, and turned into the trail leading away from the big
road.</p>
<p>Through the bare trees the clear sky shone like a shield of
blue-gray metal. It was a sky open for storm to come and pass
unchecked. The very stillness and calm were warnings of approaching
disturbance. Nature was listening and waiting for the breaking up
of autumn and the clutch of frost.</p>
<p>It was only two miles from the Centre to White&rsquo;s clearing
and the afternoon was young when Nella-Rose paused at the foot of
the last climb and took breath and courage. There was a tangled
mass of rhododendrons by the edge of the wood and suddenly the
girl&rsquo;s eyes became fixed upon it and her heart beat wildly.
Something alive was crouching there, though none but a trained
sense could have detected it! They waited&mdash;the hidden creature
and the quivering girl! Then a pair of eager, suspicious eyes shone
between the dead leaves of the bushes; next a dark, thin face
peered forth&mdash;it was Burke Lawson&rsquo;s! Nella-Rose clutched
her basket closer&mdash;that was all. After a moment she spoke
softly, but clearly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alone. You&rsquo;re safe. How long have you
been back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mor&rsquo;n two weeks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nella-Rose started. So they had known all along, and while she
had played with Marg the hunt might at any moment have become
deadly earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More&rsquo;n two weeks,&rdquo; Lawson repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s voice was hard and
cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Holler. Miss Lois Ann helped&mdash;but Lord! you
can&rsquo;t eat a helpless old woman out of house and home. Last
night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; I know. And oh, Burke, Mister Merrivale
hasn&rsquo;t forgot&mdash;the fever and your goodness. He
won&rsquo;t give you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t need to. I&rsquo;m right safe, &rsquo;cept
for food. There&rsquo;s an old hole, back of a deserted
still&mdash;I can even have a bit of fire. The devil himself
couldn&rsquo;t find me. After a time I&rsquo;m
going&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? Where, Burke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nella-Rose, would you come with me? &rsquo;Twas you as
brought me back&mdash;I had to come. If you will&mdash;oh! my
doney-gal&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! stop, Burke. Some one might be near. No, no; I
couldn&rsquo;t leave the hills&mdash;I&rsquo;d die from the
longing, you know that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&mdash;dared them all&mdash;could you take me,
Nella-Rose? I&rsquo;d run my chances with you! Night and day you
tug and pull at the heart o&rsquo; me, Nella-Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fear, and a deeper understanding, drove Nella-Rose to the wrong
course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you dare to come out&mdash;when they-all let you
stay out&mdash;then ask me again, Burke Lawson. I&rsquo;m not going
to sweetheart with one who dare not show his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her one desire was to get Lawson away; she must be free!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nella-Rose, I&rsquo;ll come out o&rsquo; this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; the girl gasped, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re not
after you to shoot you, Burke; Jed Martin is for putting you in
jail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God&mdash;the sneaking coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jim White is off raising a posse, he means
to&mdash;to see fair play. Wait until Jim comes back; then give
yourself up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;then, Nella-Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young, keen face among the dead leaves glowed with a light
that sent the blood from Nella-Rose&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See&rdquo;&mdash;she said inconsequently&mdash;&ldquo;I
have&rdquo; (she counted them out), &ldquo;I have a dozen eggs;
give them to Miss Lois Ann!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me touch you, Nella-Rose! Just let me touch your
lil&rsquo; hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until Jim White comes back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, because a rabbit scurried from its shelter, Burke Lawson
sank into his, and Nella-Rose in mad haste took to the trail and
was gone! A moment later Lawson peered out again and tried to
decide which way she went, but his wits were confused&mdash;so he
laughed that easy, fearless laugh of his and put in his hat the
eggs Nella-Rose had left. Then, crawling and edging along, he
retraced his steps to that hole in the Hollow where he knew he was
as safe as if he were in his grave.</p>
<p>With distance and reassurance on her side, Nella-Rose paused to
take breath. She had been thoroughly frightened. Her beautiful
plans, unsuspected by all the world, had been threatened by an
unlooked-for danger. She had never contemplated Burke Lawson as a
complication. She was living day by day, hour by hour. Jim White
she had accepted as a menace&mdash;but Burke never! She was no
longer the girl Lawson had known, but how could she hope to make
him understand that? Her tender, love-seeking nature had, in the
past, accepted the best the mountains offered&mdash;and Burke had
been the best. She had played with him&mdash;teased Marg with
him&mdash;revelled in the excitement, but <i>now</i>? Well, the
blindness had been torn from her eyes&mdash;the shackles from her
feet. No one, nothing, could hold her from her own! She must not be
defrauded and imprisoned again!</p>
<p>Yes, that was it&mdash;imprisoned just when she had learned to
use her wings!</p>
<p>Standing in the tangle of undergrowth, Nella-Rose clenched her
small hands and raised wide eyes to the skies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seem,&rdquo; she panted&mdash;and at that moment all
her untamed mysticism swayed her&mdash;&ldquo;like I was going
along the tracks in the dark and something is
coming&mdash;something like that train long ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she closed her eyes and her uplifted face softened and
quivered. Behind the drooping lids she saw&mdash;Truedale! Quite
vividly he materialized to her excited fancy. It was the first time
she had ever been able to command him in this fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to him!&rdquo; The words were like a
passionate prayer rather than an affirmation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to follow like I followed long ago!&rdquo; She clutched the
basket and fled along.</p>
<p>And while this was happening, Truedale, in his cabin, was
working as he had not worked in years. He had burned all his
bridges and outlying outposts; he was waiting for White, and his
plans were completed. He meant to confide everything to his only
friend&mdash;for such Jim seemed in the hazy and desolated
present&mdash;then he would marry Nella-Rose off-hand; there must
be a minister somewhere! After that? Well, after that Truedale
grasped his manuscript and fell to work like one inspired.</p>
<p>Lynda Kendall would never have known the play in its present
form. Truedale&rsquo;s ideal had always been to portray a free
woman&mdash;a super-woman; one who had evolved into the freedom
from shattered chains. He now had a heroine free, in that she had
never been enslaved. If one greater than he had put a soul in a
statue, Truedale believed that he could awaken a child of nature
and show her her own beautiful soul. He had outlined, a time back,
a sylvan Galatea; and now, as he sat in the still room, the
framework assumed form and substance; it breathed and moved him
divinely. It and he were alone in the universe; they were to begin
the world&mdash;he and&mdash;</p>
<p>Just then the advance messenger of the coming change of weather
entered by way of a lowered window. It was a smart little breeze
and it flippantly sent the ashes flying on the hearth and several
sheets of paper broadcast in the room. Truedale sprang to recover
his treasures; he caught four or five, but one escaped his notice
and floated toward the door, which was ajar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he ejaculated, &ldquo;that was a narrow
escape,&rdquo; and he began to sort and arrange the sheets on the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty, sixty-one, sixty-two. Now where in thunder is that
sixty-three?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light touch on his arm made him spring to his feet, every
nerve a-tingle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is! It seemed like it came to meet me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nella-Rose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded, holding out the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have come? Why&mdash;did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dimples came into play and Truedale stood watching them
while many emotions flayed him; but gradually his weakness passed
and he was able to assume an extremely stern though kindly manner.
He meant to set the child right; he meant to see <i>only</i> the
<i>child</i> in her until White returned; he would ignore the
perilously sweet woman-appeal to his senses until such time as he
could, with safety, let them once more hold part in their relations
with each other.</p>
<p>But even as he arrived at this wise conclusion, he was noting,
as often before he had noted, the fascinating colour and quality of
Nella-Rose&rsquo;s hair. It was both dark and light. If smoke were
filled with sunlight it would be something like the mass of more or
less loosened tendrils that crowned the girl&rsquo;s pretty head.
Stern resolve began to melt before the girlish sweetness and
audacity, but Truedale made one last struggle; he thought of
staunch and true Brace Kendall! And, be it to Brace Kendall&rsquo;s
credit, the course Conning endeavoured to take was a wise one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Nella-Rose, you ought not to come
here&mdash;alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Aren&rsquo;t you glad to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. But why did you come?&rdquo; This was risky.
Truedale recognized it at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to say&mdash;&lsquo;how-de&rsquo;! You certainly do
look scroogy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Truedale laughed. Nella-Rose&rsquo;s capacity for
bringing forth his happier, merrier nature was one of her endearing
charms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t come just for that, Nella-Rose!&rdquo;
This with stern disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off the scroogy face&mdash;then I&rsquo;ll tell you
why I came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; Truedale smiled weakly.
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right hungry. I&mdash;I want a
party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course this would never do. White, or one of the
blood-and-thunder raiders, might appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go, Nella-Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not&rdquo;&mdash;here she sat down firmly and undid her
ridiculous plaid shawl&mdash;&ldquo;not till you give me a bite.
Just a mighty little bite&mdash;I&rsquo;m starving!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Truedale roared with laughter and went hurriedly to his
closet. The girl must eat and&mdash;<i>go</i>. Mechanically he set
about placing food upon the table. Then he sat opposite Nella-Rose
while she ate with frank enjoyment the remains of his own noon-day
meal. He could not but note, as he often did, the daintiness with
which she accomplished the task. Other women, as Truedale
remembered, were not prepossessing when attacking food; but this
girl made a gracious little ceremony of the affair. She placed the
small dishes in orderly array before her; she poised herself
lightly on the edge of the chair and nibbled&mdash;there was no
other word for it&mdash;as a perky little chipmunk might, the
morsels she raised gracefully to her mouth. She was genuinely
hungry and for a few minutes devoted her attention to the matter in
hand.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, Nella-Rose did something that shattered the last
scrap of self-control that was associated with the trusty Kendall
and his good example. She raised a bit of food on her fork and held
it out to Truedale, her lovely eyes looking wistfully into his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please! I feel so ornery eating alone. I want
to&mdash;share! Please play party with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale tried to say &ldquo;I had my dinner an hour ago&rdquo;;
instead, he leaned across his folded arms and murmured, as if quite
outside his own volition:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I love you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nella-Rose dropped the fork and leaned back. Her lids fell over
the wide eyes&mdash;the smile faded from her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you belong to any one&mdash;else,
Nella-Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;oh! no.&rdquo; This like a frightened cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But others&mdash;some one must have told you&mdash;of
love. Do you know what love means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now she looked at him. Her eyes were dark, her face deadly
pale; her lips were so red that in the whiteness they seemed the
only trace of colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know? Why because&mdash;nothing else matters. It
seems like I&rsquo;ve been coming all my life to it&mdash;and now
it just says: &lsquo;Here I am,
Nella-Rose&mdash;here&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too, have been coming to it all my life, little girl.
I did not know&mdash;I was driven. I rebelled, because I did not
know; but nothing else <i>does</i> matter, when&mdash;love gets
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Nothing matters.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s voice was
rapt and dreamy. Truedale put his hands across the space dividing
them and took hold of hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be&mdash;mine, Nella-Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like I must be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Doesn&rsquo;t it? Do you&mdash;you must understand,
dear? I mean to live the rest of my life here in the
hills&mdash;your hills. You once said one was of the hills or one
wasn&rsquo;t; will they let me stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;almost
fiercely&mdash;&ldquo;but&mdash;but your folks&mdash;off
there&mdash;will they let you stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no folks, Nella-Rose. I&rsquo;m lonely and
poor&mdash;at least I was until I found you! The hills have given
me&mdash;everything; I mean to serve them well in return. I want
you for my wife, Nella-Rose; we&rsquo;ll make a
home&mdash;somewhere&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter; it will be a
shelter for our love and&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped short. Reality
and conventions made a last vain appeal. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
you ever again to go out of my sight. You&rsquo;re mine and nothing
could make that different&mdash;but&rdquo; (and this came quickly,
desperately) &ldquo;there must be a minister
somewhere&mdash;let&rsquo;s go to him! Do not let us waste another
precious day. When he makes you mine by his&rdquo;&mdash;Truedale
was going to say &ldquo;ridiculous jargon&rdquo; but he modified it
to&mdash;&ldquo;his authority, no one in all God&rsquo;s world can
take you from me. Come, come <i>now</i>, sweetheart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another moment he would have had her in his arms, but she
held him off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty afraid of old Jim White!&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>Truedale laughed, but the words brought him to his senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must go, darling, until White returns. After I
have explained to him I will come for you, but first let me hold
you&mdash;so! and kiss you&mdash;so! This is why&mdash;you must go,
my love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was in his arms, her lifted face pressed to his. She
shivered, but clung to him for a moment and two tears rolled down
her cheeks&mdash;the first he had ever seen escape her control. He
kissed them away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what are you thinking, Nella-Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking? I&rsquo;m not thinking;
I&rsquo;m&mdash;happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My&mdash;sweetheart!&rdquo; Again Truedale pressed his
lips to hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us-all calls
sweetheart&mdash;&lsquo;doney-gal&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My&mdash;my doney-gal, then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&rdquo;&mdash;the words came muffled, for Truedale was
holding her still&mdash;&ldquo;and always I shall see your face,
now. It came to-day like it came long ago. It will always come and
make me glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale lifted her from his breast and held her at arms&rsquo;
length. He looked deep into her eyes, trying to pierce through her
ignorance and childishness to find the elusive woman that could
meet and bear its part in what lay before. Long they gazed at each
other&mdash;then the light in Nella-Rose&rsquo;s face
quivered&mdash;her mouth drooped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;going till
Jim White comes back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait&mdash;my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the girl had slipped from his grasp; she was gone into the
misty, threatening grayness that had closed in about them while
love had carried them beyond their depths. Then the rain began to
fall&mdash;heavy, warning drops. The wind, too, was rising sullenly
like a monster roused from its sleep and slowly gathering power to
vent its rage.</p>
<p>Into this darkening storm Nella-Rose fled unheedingly. She was
not herself&mdash;not the girl of the woods, wise in mountain lore;
she was bewitched and half mad with the bewildering emotions that,
at one moment frightened her&mdash;the next, carried her closer to
the spiritual than she had ever been.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>Alone in his cabin, Truedale was conscious of a sort of
groundless terror that angered him. The storm could not account for
it&mdash;he had the advantage of ignorance there! Certainly his
last half-hour could not be responsible for his sensations. He
justified every minute of it by terms as old as man&rsquo;s desires
and his resentment of restrictions. &ldquo;Our lives are our
own!&rdquo; he muttered, setting to work to build a fire and to
light the lamp. &ldquo;They will all come around to my way of
seeing things when I have made good and taken her back to
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still this arguing brought no peace, and more and more Truedale
found himself relying upon Jim White&rsquo;s opinions. In that
troubled hour the sheriff stood like a rugged sign post in the
path. One unflinching finger pointed to the past; the
other&mdash;to the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! I&rsquo;ve chosen,&rdquo; thought Truedale;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s the new way and&mdash;thank God!&rdquo; But he
felt that the future could be made possible or miserable by
Jim&rsquo;s favour or disapproval.</p>
<p>Having decided to follow upon White&rsquo;s counsel, Truedale
mentally prayed for his return, and at once. The fact was, Truedale
was drugged and he had just sense enough left to know it! He
vaguely realized that the half-hour with Nella-Rose had been a
dangerous epoch in his life. He was safe, thank heaven! but he
dared not trust himself just now without a stronger will to guide
him!</p>
<p>While he busied himself at feeding the animals, preparing and
clearing away his own evening meal, he grew calmer. The storm was
gaining in fury&mdash;and he was thankful for it! He was shut away
from possible temptation; he even found it easy to think of Kendall
and of Lynda, but he utterly eliminated his uncle from his mind.
Between him and old William Truedale the gulf seemed to have become
impassable!</p>
<p>And while Truedale sank into an unsafe mental calm, Nella-Rose
pushed her way into the teeth of the storm and laughed and
chattered like a mad and lost little nymph. Wind and rain always
exhilarated her and the fury of the elements, gaining force every
minute, did not alarm her while the memory of her great experience
held sway over her. She shook her hair back from her wide, vague
eyes. She was undecided where to go for the night&mdash;it did not
matter greatly; to-morrow she would go again to Truedale, or he
would come to her. At last she settled upon seeking the shelter of
old Lois Ann, in Devil-may-come Hollow, and turned in that
direction.</p>
<p>It was eight o&rsquo;clock then and Truedale, with his books and
papers on the table before him, declared: &ldquo;I am quite all
right now,&rdquo; and fell to work upon the manuscript that earlier
had engrossed him.</p>
<p>As the time sped by he was able to visualize the play; <i>he</i>
was sitting in the audience&mdash;he beheld the changing scenes and
the tense climax. He even began to speculate upon the particular
star that would be fitted for the leading part. His one
extravagance, in the past, had been cut-rate seats in the best
theatres.</p>
<p>Suddenly the mood passed and all at once Truedale realized that
he was tired&mdash;deadly tired. The perspiration stood on his
forehead&mdash;he ached from the strain of cramped muscles. Then he
looked at his watch; it was eleven o&rsquo;clock! The stillness out
of doors bespoke a sullen break in the storm. A determined
drip-drip from roof and trees was like the ticking of a huge clock
running down, but good for some time. The fire had died out, not a
bit of red showed in the ashes, but the room was hot, still.
Truedale decided to go to bed without it, and, having come to that
conclusion, he bent his head upon his folded arms and sank into a
deep sleep.</p>
<p>Suddenly he awoke. The room was cold and dark! The lamp had
burned itself out and the storm was again howling in its second
attack. Chilled and obsessed by an unnerving sense of danger,
Truedale waited for&mdash;he knew not what! Just then something
pressed against his leg and he put his hand down thinking one of
the dogs was crouching close, but a whispered &ldquo;sh!&rdquo; set
every muscle tense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nella-Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but, oh! be mighty still. They may be here any
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They? Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of them. Jed Martin, my father, and the
others&mdash;the ones who are friends of&mdash;of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom, Nella-Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burke Lawson! He&rsquo;s back&mdash;and they
think&mdash;oh! they think they are on his trail&mdash;here!
I&mdash;I was trying to get away but the streams were swollen and
the big trees were bending and&mdash;and I hid behind a rock
and&mdash;I heard!</p>
<p>&ldquo;First it was Jed and father; they said they were going to
shoot&mdash;they&rsquo;d given up catching Burke alive! Then they
went up-stream and the&mdash;the others came&mdash;the friends, and
they &rsquo;lowed that Burke was here and they meant to get here
before Jed and&mdash;and da some killing on their side. I&mdash;I
thought it was fun when they-all meant to take Burke alive, but
now&mdash;oh! now can&rsquo;t you see?&mdash;they&rsquo;ll shoot
and find out afterward! They may come any minute! I put the light
out. Come, we must leave the cabin empty-looking&mdash;like you had
gone&mdash;and hide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The breathless whispering stopped and Truedale collected his
senses in the face of this real danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;you must not be here,
Nella-Rose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every nerve was alert now. &ldquo;This is pure madness. Great
heavens! what am I going to do with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seriousness of the situation overpowered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; The warning was caused by the restlessness of
the dogs outside. Their quick ears were sensing danger or&mdash;the
coming of their master! Either possibility was equally
alarming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you do not understand,&rdquo; Nella-Rose was pleading
by his knee. &ldquo;If they-all see you, they will have you killed
that minute. Burke is the only one in their minds&mdash;they
don&rsquo;t even know that you live; they&rsquo;re too full of
Burke, and if they see me&mdash;why&mdash;they&rsquo;d kill you
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can I do with you?&rdquo; That thought alone
swayed Truedale.</p>
<p>Then Nella-Rose got upon her feet and stood close to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m yours! I gave myself to you. You&mdash;you
wanted me. Are you sorry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The simple pride and dignity went straight to Truedale&rsquo;s
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I want you so, little girl, that I
must save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow Nella-Rose seemed to have lost her fear of the oncoming
raiders; she spoke deliberately, and above a whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me?&mdash;from what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were no words to convey to her his meaning. Truedale felt
almost ashamed to hold it in his own mind. They so inevitably
belonged to each other; why should they question?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I shall not go away&mdash;again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling, you must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word brought him to his senses&mdash;where, indeed? With the
dark woods full of armed men ready to fire at any moving thing in
human shape, he could not let her go! That conclusion reached, and
all anchors cut, the danger and need of the hour claimed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; you are mine!&rdquo; he whispered, gathering her to
him. &ldquo;What does anything matter but our safety to-night?
To-morrow; well, to-morrow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No ear but one trained to the secrets of the still places could
have detected a sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are coming! Yes, not the many&mdash;it is Jed! Come!
While you slept I carried a right many things to the rhododendron
slick back of the house! See, push over the chair&mdash;leave the
door open like you&rsquo;d gone away before the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly and silently Nella-Rose suited action to word. Truedale
watched her like one bewitched. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; She took him by
the hand and the next minute they were out on the wet, sodden
leaves; the next they were crouching close under the bushes where
even the heavy rain had not penetrated. Half-consciously Truedale
recognized some of his property near by&mdash;his clothing, two or
three books, and&mdash;yes&mdash;it was his manuscript! The white
roll was safe! How she must have worked while he slept.</p>
<p>Once only did she speak until danger was past. Nestling close in
his arms, her head upon his shoulder, she breathed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they-all shoot, we&rsquo;ll die together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unreality of the thing gradually wore upon Truedale&rsquo;s
tense nerves. If anything was going to happen he wanted it to
happen! In another half-hour he meant to put an end to the farce
and move his belongings back to the cabin and take Nella-Rose home.
It was a nightmare&mdash;nothing less!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; and then the waiting was over. Two dark
figures, guns ready, stole from the woods behind White&rsquo;s
cabin. Where were the dogs? Why did they not speak out?&mdash;but
the dogs were trained to be as silent as the men. They were all
part and parcel of the secret lawlessness of the hills. In the dim
light Truedale watched the shadowy forms enter Jim&rsquo;s unlocked
cabin and presently issue forth, evidently convinced that the prey
was not there&mdash;had not been there! Then as stealthy as Indians
they made their way to the other cabin&mdash;Truedale&rsquo;s late
shelter. They kept to the bushes and the edge of the
woods&mdash;they were like creeping animals until they reached the
shack; then, standing erect and close, they went in the doorway. So
near was the hiding place of Truedale and his companion that they
could hear the oaths of the hunters as they became aware that their
quarry had escaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been here, all right!&rdquo; It was Jed Martin
who spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon he&rsquo;s caught on,&rdquo; Peter Greyson
drawled, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; for Jim White. White
ain&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n fifteen miles back; we can cut him off,
Jed, &rsquo;fore he reaches safety&mdash;the skunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the two emerged from the cabin and strode boldly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others!&rdquo; whispered Truedale&mdash;&ldquo;will
they come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a stir&mdash;a trampling&mdash;but apparently the
newcomers did not see Martin and Greyson. There was a crackling of
underbrush by feet no longer feeling need of caution, then another
space of silence before safety was made sure for the two in the
bushes.</p>
<p>At last Truedale dared to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nella-Rose!&rdquo; He looked down at the face upon his
breast. She was asleep&mdash;deeply, exhaustedly asleep!</p>
<p>Truedale shifted his position. He was cramped and aching; still
the even breathing did not break. He laid her down gently and put a
heavy coat about her&mdash;one that earlier she had carried from
the cabin in her effort to save him. He went to the house and
grimly set to work. First he lighted a fire; then he righted the
chairs and brought about some order from the chaos. He was no
longer afraid of any man on God&rsquo;s earth; even Jim White was
relegated to the non-essentials. Truedale was merely a primitive
creature caring for his own! There was no turning back now&mdash;no
waiting upon conventions. When he had made ready he was going out
to bring his own to her home!</p>
<p>The sullen, soggy night, with its bursts of fury and periods of
calm, had settled down, apparently, to a drenching, businesslike
rain. The natives knew how to estimate such weather. By daylight
the streams would be raging rivers on whose currents trees and
animals would be carried ruthlessly to the lowlands. Roads would be
obliterated and human beings would seek shelter wherever they could
find it.</p>
<p>But Truedale was spared the worry this knowledge might have
brought him. He concentrated now upon the present and grimly
accepted conditions as they were. All power or inclination for
struggle was past; the inheritance of weakness which old William
Truedale had feared and with which Conning himself had so contended
in his barren youth, asserted itself and prepared to take
unquestioningly what the present offered.</p>
<p>At that moment Truedale believed himself arbiter of his own fate
and Nella-Rose&rsquo;s. Conditions had forced him to this position
and he was ready to assume responsibility. There was no
alternative; he must accept things as they were and make them
secure later on. For himself the details of convention did not
matter. He had always despised them. In his youthful spiritual
anarchy he had flouted them openly; they made no claim upon his
attention now, except where Nella-Rose was concerned. Appearances
were against him and her, but none but fools would allow that to
daunt them. He, Truedale, felt that no law of man was needed to
hold him to the course he had chosen, back on the day when he
determined to forsake the past and fling his fortunes in with the
new. Never in his life was Conning Truedale more sincere or, he
believed, more wise, than he was at that moment. And just then
Nella-Rose appeared coming down the rain-drenched path like a
little ghost in the grim, gray dawn. She still wore the heavy coat
he had put about her, and her eyes were dreamy and vague.</p>
<p>Truedale strode toward her and took her in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;are you able to
come with me now&mdash;at once&mdash;to the minister? It must be
now, sweetheart&mdash;now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him like a child trying to understand his
mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said presently, &ldquo;I &rsquo;most
forgot. The minister has gone to a burying back in the hills;
he&rsquo;ll be gone a right long time. Bill Trim, who carries all
the news, told me to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he, Nella-Rose?&rdquo; Something seemed
tightening around Truedale&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us-all don&rsquo;t know; he left it written on his
door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is there another minister, Nella-Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is absurd&mdash;of course there is another. We must
start at once and find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; The face upon Truedale&rsquo;s breast was
lifted. &ldquo;You hear that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. What is it?&rdquo; Truedale was alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that the little streams are rivers; it means
that the trails are full of rocks and trees; it
means&rdquo;&mdash;the words sank to an awed
whisper&mdash;&ldquo;it means that we must <i>fight</i> for what
we-all want to keep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God! Nella-Rose, but where can I take
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no place&mdash;but here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed an hour that the silence lasted while Truedale faced
this new phase and came to his desperate conclusion.</p>
<p>Had any one suggested to him then that his decision was the
decision of weakness, or immemorial evil, he would have resented
the thought with bitterest scorn. Unknowingly he was being tempted
by the devil in him, and he fell; he had only himself to look to
for salvation from his mistaken impulses, and his best self,
unprepared, was drugged by the overpowering appeal that Nella-Rose
made to his senses.</p>
<p>Standing with the girl in his arms; listening to the oncoming
danger which, he realized at last, might destroy him and her at any
moment; bereft of every one&mdash;everything that could have held
them to the old ideals; Truedale saw but one course&mdash;and took
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no place but here&mdash;no one but you and
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soft tones penetrated to the troubled place where Truedale
seemed to stand alone making his last, losing fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, by heaven!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let us accept
it&mdash;you and I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had crossed his Rubicon.</p>
<p>They ate, almost solemnly; they listened to that awful roar
growing more and more distinct and menacing. Nella-Rose was still
and watchful, but Truedale had never been more cruelly alive than
he was then when, with his wider knowledge, he realized the step he
had taken. Whether it were for life or death, he had blotted out
effectually all that had gone to the making of the man he once was.
Whatever hope he might have had of making Lynda Kendall and Brace
understand, had things gone as he once had planned, there was no
hope now. No&mdash;he and Nella-Rose were alone and helpless in the
danger-haunted hills. He and she!</p>
<p>The sun made an effort to come forth later but the rush and roar
of the oncoming torrent seemed to daunt it. For an hour it
struggled, then gave up. But during that hour Truedale led
Nella-Rose from the house. Silently they made their way to a little
hilltop from which they could see an open space of dull, leaden
sky. There Truedale took the girl&rsquo;s hands in his and lifted
his eyes while his benumbed soul sought whatever God there might
be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Thy sight,&rdquo; he said slowly, deeply, &ldquo;I
take this woman for my wife. Bless us; keep us;
and&rdquo;&mdash;after a pause&mdash;&ldquo;deal Thou with me as I
deal with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the earnest eyes dropped to the frightened ones searching
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mine!&rdquo; Truedale spoke commandingly, with a
force that never before had marked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The word was a faint, frightened whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling, kiss me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kissed him with trembling lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you trust me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;oh! yes; yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come, my doney-gal! For life or death, it is you and
I, little woman, from now on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a flash his gloom departed. He was gay, desperate, and free
of all hampering doubts. In such a mood Nella-Rose lost all fear of
him and walked by his side as complacently as if the one minister
in her sordid little world had with all his strange authority said
his sacred &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; over her.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>There were five days of terrific storm. Truedale and Nella-Rose
had fought to save White&rsquo;s live stock&mdash;even his cabin
itself; for the deluge had attacked that while leaving safe the
smaller cabin near by. All one morning they had worked gathering
d&eacute;bris and placing it so that it turned the course of a
rapid stream that threatened the larger house. It had been almost a
lost hope, but as the day wore on the torrent lessened, the rough
barrier held&mdash;they were successful! The gate and snake-fence
were carried away, but the rest was saved!</p>
<p>In the strenuous labour, in the dangerous isolation, the
ordinary things of life lost their importance. With death facing
them their love and companionship were all that were left to them
and neither counted the cost. But on the sixth day the sun shone,
the flood was past, and with safety and the sure coming of Jim
White at hand, they sat confronting each other in a silence new and
potent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweetheart, you must go&mdash;for a few hours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale bent across the table that separated them and took her
clasped hands in his. He had burned all his social bridges, but
poor Nella-Rose&rsquo;s progress through life had not been made
over anything so substantial as bridges. She had proceeded by
scrambling down and up primitive obstacles; she felt that at last
she had come to her Land of Promise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to send me&mdash;away? Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only until White returns, little girl. See here, dear,
you and I are quite gloriously mad, but others are stupidly sane
and we&rsquo;ve got to think of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale was talking over her head, but already Nella-Rose
accepted this as a phase of their new relations. A mountain man
might still love his woman even if he beat her and, while
Nella-Rose would have scorned the suggestion that she was a
mountain woman, she did seriously believe that men were different
from women and that was the end of the matter!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You run along, small girl of mine&mdash;the skies are
clear, the sun warm&mdash;but I want you to meet me at three
o&rsquo;clock at the spot where the trail joins the road. I will be
there and I will wait for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&mdash;why?&rdquo; The blue-gray eyes were
troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweetheart, we&rsquo;re going to find that minister of
yours if we have to travel from one end of the hills to the
other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we-all are married!&rdquo; This with a little gasp.
&ldquo;Back on the hill, when you told God and said He understood;
then we-all were married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so we were, my sweet, no minister could make you more
mine than you already are, but the others&mdash;your people. Should
they try to separate us they might cause trouble and the minister
can make it impossible for any one to take you away from my love
and care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at that moment Truedale actually believed what he said. In
his heart he had always been a rebel&mdash;defiant and impotent. He
had, in this instance, proved his theories; but he did not intend
to leave loose ends that might endanger the safety of
others&mdash;of this young girl, most of all. He was only going to
carry out his original plans for her safety&mdash;not his own.
After the days just past&mdash;days of anxiety, relief, and the
proving of his love and hers&mdash;no doubt remained in
Truedale&rsquo;s heart; he was of the hills, now and forever!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can&mdash;<i>now</i>!&rdquo; This came
passionately from Nella-Rose as she watched him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might make trouble until they found that out.
They&rsquo;re too free with their guns. There&rsquo;s a lot to
explain, little doney-gal.&rdquo; Conning smiled down her
doubts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until three o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; Nella-Rose pouted,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s a right long time. But I&rsquo;ll&mdash;just
run along. Always and always I&rsquo;m going to do what you
say!&rdquo; Already his power over her was absolute. She put her
arms out with a happy, wilful gesture and Truedale held her
closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only until three, sweetheart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nella-Rose drew herself away and turned to pick up her little
shawl and hat from the couch by the fire; she was just reaching for
her basket, when a shadow fell across the floor. Truedale and the
girl turned and confronted&mdash;Jim White! What he had seen and
heard&mdash;who could tell from his expressionless face and steady
voice? The door had been on the latch and he had come in!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mail, and truck, and rabbits!&rdquo; he explained,
tossing his load upon the table. Then he turned toward Truedale as
if noticing him for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How-de?&rdquo; he said. Finally his gaze shifted to
Nella-Rose and seemed to burn into her soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo;, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps,
or&mdash;comin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I am&mdash;going!&rdquo; Fright and dismay marked
the girl&rsquo;s voice. Truedale went toward her. The covert
brutality in White&rsquo;s words shocked and angered him. He gave
no thought to the cause, but he resented the insult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he commanded, for Nella-Rose was gone
through the open door. &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that she had for the moment escaped him, Truedale turned
to White and confronted him with clear, angry eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got to say for yourself?&rdquo; he demanded
fiercely.</p>
<p>The shock had been tremendous for Jim. Three weeks previously he
had left his charge safe and alone; he had come back and
found&mdash;But shock always stiffened Jim White; that was one
reason for his success in life. He was never so inflexible and
deadly self-possessed as he was when he could not see the next step
ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gawd, but I&rsquo;m tired!&rdquo; he said, when he had
stared at Truedale as long as he cared to, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
over to my place to turn in. Seems like I&rsquo;ll sleep for a
month once I get started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t go, White, until you explain what you
meant by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Truedale mistook his man. Jim, having drawn his own
conclusion, laughed and strode toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go when I&rsquo;m damned pleased ter go!&rdquo; he
flung out derisively, &ldquo;and I come the same way, young feller.
There&rsquo;s mail for yo&rsquo; in the sack and&mdash;a
telegram.&rdquo; White paused by the door a moment while Truedale
picked the yellow envelope from the bag and tore it open.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Your uncle died suddenly on the 16th. Come at once.
Vitally important. McPHERSON.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>For a moment both men forgot the thing that had driven them wide
apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad news?&rdquo; asked the sheriff.</p>
<p>Something was happening to Truedale&mdash;he felt as if the
effect of some narcotic were losing its power; the fevered
unreality was giving place to sensation but the brain was recording
it dully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What date is this?&rdquo; he asked, dazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-fifth,&rdquo; Jim replied as he moved out of the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When can I get a train from the station?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one as leaves anywhere &rsquo;twixt nine
and ten ter-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That gives me time to pack. See here, White, while it
isn&rsquo;t any of your business, I want to explain a thing or
two&mdash;before I go. I&rsquo;ll be back as soon as I can&mdash;in
a week or ten days at furthest. When I return I intend to stay on,
probably for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>White still held Truedale by the cold, steely gleam of his eyes
which was driving lucidity home to the dulled brain. By a power as
unyielding as death Jim was destroying the screen Truedale had
managed to raise against the homely codes of life and was leaving
his guest naked and exposed.</p>
<p>The shock of the telegram&mdash;the pause it evolved&mdash;had
given Truedale time to catch the meaning of White&rsquo;s attitude;
now that he realized it, he knew he must lay certain facts
open&mdash;he could not wait until his return.</p>
<p>Presently Jim spoke from outside the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t settin&rsquo; up for no critic. I
ain&rsquo;t by nater a weigher or trimmer and I don&rsquo;t care a
durn for what ain&rsquo;t my business. When I <i>see</i> my
business I settle it in my own way!&rdquo;&mdash;there was almost a
warning in this. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dead tired, root and branch.
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; ter take a bite an&rsquo; turn in. I may
sleep a couple o&rsquo; days; put off yo&rsquo;
&rsquo;splainifyin&rsquo; &rsquo;til yo&rsquo; come back ter end
yo&rsquo; days. Take the mare an&rsquo; leave her by the trail;
she&rsquo;ll come home. Tell old Doc McPherson I was askin&rsquo;
arter him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By that time Jim had ceased scorching his way to
Truedale&rsquo;s soul and was on the path to his own cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like yo&rsquo; had a tussle with the storm,&rdquo;
he remarked. &ldquo;Any livin&rsquo; thing killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank yo&rsquo;!&rdquo; Then, as if determined not to
share any further confidence, White strode on.</p>
<p>For a moment Truedale stood and stared after his host in
impotent rage. Was Jim White such a lily of purity that he presumed
to take that attitude? Was the code of the hills that of the Romany
gypsies? How dare any man judge and sentence another without
trial?</p>
<p>The effect of the narcotic still worked sluggishly, now that
White&rsquo;s irritating presence was removed. Truedale shrugged
his shoulders and turned to his packing. He was feverishly eager to
get to Nella-Rose. Before nightfall she would be his before the
world; in two weeks he would be back; the future would shame White
and bring him to his senses. Jim had a soft heart; he was just, in
his brutal fashion. When he understood how matters were, he would
feel like the fool he was&mdash;a fool willing to cast a man off,
unheard! But Truedale blamed himself for the hesitation that meant
so much. The telegram&mdash;his fear of making a wrong
step&mdash;had caused the grave mistake that could not be righted
now.</p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock Truedale started&mdash;on Jim&rsquo;s mare!
White&rsquo;s cabin had all the appearance of being barred against
intrusion. Truedale did not mean to test this, but it hurt him like
a blow. However, there was nothing to do but remedy, as soon as
possible, the error he had permitted to arise. No man on earth
could make Nella-Rose more his than his love and good faith had
made her, still he was eager now to resort to all the time-honoured
safeguards before he left. Once married he would go with a heart
almost light. He would confide everything to Kendall and
Lynda&mdash;at least he would his marriage&mdash;and urge them to
return with him to the hills, and after that White and all the
others would have an awakening. The possibility thus conceived was
like a flood of light and sweet air in a place dark and bewildering
but not evil&mdash;no, not that!</p>
<p>As he turned from the clearing Truedale looked back at his
cabin. Nella-Rose seemed still there. She would always be part of
it just as she was now part of his life. He would try and buy the
cabin&mdash;it would be sacrilege for others to enter!</p>
<p>So he hurried the mare on, hoping to be at the crossing before
Nella-Rose.</p>
<p>The crisp autumn air was redolent of pines and the significance
of summer long past. It had a physical and spiritual power.</p>
<p>Then turning suddenly from the trail, Truedale saw Nella-Rose
sitting on a rock&mdash;waiting! She had on a rough,
mannish-looking coat, and a coarse, red hood covered her bright
head. Nella-Rose was garbed in winter attire. She had worn this
outfit for five years and it looked it.</p>
<p>Never again was Truedale to see a face of such radiant joy and
trust as the girl turned upon him. Her eyes were wide and filled
with a light that startled him. He jumped from the horse and took
her in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, fearing some intangible
danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The minister was killed by the flood!&rdquo;
Nella-Rose&rsquo;s tones were thrilling. &ldquo;He was going
through Devil-may-come Hollow and a mighty big rock struck him
and&mdash;he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must come with me, Nella-Rose.&rdquo; Truedale
set his lips grimly; there was no time to lose. Between three and
nine o&rsquo;clock surely they could locate a minister or a justice
of the peace. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why, Mister Man?&rdquo; She laughed up at him.
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. To New York if necessary. Jump
up!&rdquo; He turned to the horse, holding the girl close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me go away&mdash;in this? Me shame you
before&mdash;them-all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nella-Rose stood her ground and throwing the rough coat back
displayed her shabby, shrunken dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went home&mdash;they-all were away. I got my warm
things, but I have a white dress and a pink ribbon&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
get them to-morrow. Then&mdash;But why must we
go&mdash;away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time this thought caught her&mdash;she had been
whirled along too rapidly before to note it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had word that my uncle is dead. I must go at once,
my dear, and you&mdash;you must come with me. Would you let a
little thing like a&mdash;a dress weigh against our love, and
honour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Above the native&rsquo;s horror of being dragged from her
moorings was that subtle understanding of honour that had come to
Nella-Rose by devious ways from a source that held it sacred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honour?&rdquo; she repeated softly; &ldquo;honour? If I
thought I had to go in rags to make you sure; if I thought I needed
to&mdash;I&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale saw his mistake. Realizing that if in the little time
yet his he made her comprehend, he might lose more than he could
hope to gain, he let her free while he took a card and pen from his
pocket. He wrote clearly and exactly his address, giving his
uncle&rsquo;s home as his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nella-Rose,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;I shall be back
in two or three weeks at the latest, but if at any moment you want
me, send word here&mdash;telegraph from the
station&mdash;<i>you</i> come first, always! You are wiser than I,
my sweet; our honour and love are our own. Wait for me, my
doney-gal and&mdash;trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was all joy again&mdash;all sweetness. He kissed her,
turned, then came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will you go, my darling?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since they-all do not know&rdquo;&mdash;she was lying
against his breast, her eyes heavy now with grief at the
parting&mdash;&ldquo;I reckon I will go home&mdash;to
wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Solemnly Truedale kissed her and turned dejectedly away. Once
again he paused and looked back. She stood against the tree, small
and shabby, but the late afternoon sun transfigured her. In the
gloomy setting of the woods, that fair, little face shone like a
gleaming star and so Truedale remembered her and took her image
with him on his lonely way.</p>
<p>Nella-Rose watched him out of sight and then she turned and did
something that well might make one wonder if a wise God or a cruel
demon controls our fates&mdash;she ran away from the home path and
took the trail leading far back to the cabin of old Lois Ann!</p>
<p>There was safety; there were compassion and comprehension. The
old woman could tell marvellous tales and so could beguile the
waiting days. Nella-Rose meant to confide in her and ask her to
hide her until Truedale came for her. It was a sudden inspiration
and it brought relief.</p>
<p>And that night&mdash;it was past midnight and cold as the north
land&mdash;Burke Lawson came face to face with Jed Martin! Lawson
was issuing from his cranny behind the old still and Martin was
nosing about alone. He, like a hungry thing of the wilds, had found
his foe&rsquo;s trail and meant to bag him unaided and have full
vengeance and glory. But so unexpectedly, and alarmingly
unconcerned, did Burke materialize in the emptiness that
Jed&rsquo;s gun was a minute too late in getting into position.
Lawson had the drop on him! They were both very quiet for a moment,
then Lawson laughed and did it so boldly that Jed shrank back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming to make a friendly call, Martin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come in, come right in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you an&rsquo; me can settle what we&rsquo;ve got
ter settle in the open!&rdquo; Jed stuttered. It seemed a hideous,
one-sided settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As yo&rsquo; please, Jed, as yo&rsquo; please. I have a
leanin&rsquo; to the open myself. I&rsquo;d just decided ter come
out; I was going up ter Jim White&rsquo;s and help him mete out
justice, but maybe you and me can save him the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;goin&rsquo; ter shoot me, Burke&mdash;like
a&mdash;like a&mdash;hedgehog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; ter do unto yo&rsquo; as
yo&rsquo; would have&mdash;&rdquo; Here Burke laughed&mdash;he was
enjoying himself hugely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What yo&rsquo; mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; ter put yer in my quarters
and tie yer to a chair. Yo&rsquo;ll be able to wiggle out in time,
but it will take yer long enough fur me to do what I&rsquo;m set
about doin&rsquo;. Yo&rsquo; torn down traitor!&mdash;yo&rsquo;
were &rsquo;lowing to put me behind bars, wasn&rsquo;t yer?
Yo&rsquo; meant to let outsiders take the life out o&rsquo;
me&mdash;yo&rsquo; skunk! Well, instead, Jed&mdash;I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; on my weddin&rsquo; trip&mdash;me and lil&rsquo;
Nella-Rose. I&rsquo;ve seen her; she done promised to have me, when
I come out o&rsquo; hidin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m coming out now!
Nella-Rose an&rsquo; me are goin&rsquo; to find a bigger place than
Pine Cone Settlement. Yo&rsquo;ll wiggle yer blasted hide loose by
mornin&rsquo; maybe; but then her an&rsquo; me&rsquo;ll be where
you-all can&rsquo;t ketch us! Go in there, now, you green lizard;
turn about an&rsquo; get on yer belly like the crawlin&rsquo; thing
yo&rsquo; are! That&rsquo;s it&mdash;go! the way opens
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jed was crawling through the bushes, Lawson after him with
levelled gun. &ldquo;Now, then, take a seat an&rsquo; make yerself
ter home!&rdquo; Jed got to the chair and turned a green-white face
upon his tormentor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer goin&rsquo; ter let me starve here?&rdquo; he asked
with shaking voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on yo&rsquo; power to wiggle. See, I tie you
so!&rdquo; Lawson had pounced upon Jed and had him pinioned.
&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; ter turn a key on yer like
yo&rsquo; was aimin&rsquo; ter do on me! It&rsquo;s up to yo&rsquo;
an&rsquo; yer wigglin&rsquo; powers, when yo&rsquo; get free. The
emptier yer belly is, the more room ye&rsquo;ll have fer wiggling.
God bless yer! yer dog-gone hound! Bless yer an&rsquo;&mdash;curse
yer! I&rsquo;m off&mdash;with the doney-gal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And off he was&mdash;he and his cruel but gay laugh.</p>
<p>There was no fire in the cave-like place; no light but the
indirect moonlight which slanted through the opening. It was death
or wiggle for Jed Martin&mdash;so he wiggled!</p>
<p>In the meantime, Burke headed for Jim White&rsquo;s. He meant to
play a high game there&mdash;to fling himself on White&rsquo;s
mercy&mdash;appeal to the liking he knew the sheriff had for
him&mdash;confess his love for Nella-Rose&mdash;make his promise
for future redemption and then go, scot-free, to claim the girl who
had declared he might speak when once again he dared walk upright
among his fellows. So Lawson planned and went bravely to the doing
of it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>At Washington, Truedale telegraphed to Brace Kendall. He felt,
as he drew nearer and nearer to the old haunts, like a stranger,
and a blind, groping one at that. The noises of the city disturbed
and confused him; the crowds irritated him. When he remembered the
few weeks that lay between the present and the days when he was
part and parcel of this so-called life, he experienced a sensation
of having died and been compelled to return to earth to finish some
business carelessly overlooked. He meant to rectify the omission as
soon as possible and get back to the safety and peace of the hills.
How different it all would be with settled ideas, definite work,
and Nella-Rose!</p>
<p>While waiting for his train in the Washington station he was
startled to find that, of a sudden, he was adrift between the Old
and the New. If he repudiated the past, the future as sternly
repudiated him. He could not reconcile his love and desire with his
identity. Somehow the man he had left, when he went South, appeared
now to have been waiting for him on his return, and while his
plans, nicely arranged, seemed feasible the actual readjustment
struck him as lurid and impossible. The fact was that his
experience of life in Pine Cone made him now shrink from contact
with the outside world as one of its loyal natives might have done.
It could no more survive in the garish light of a city day than
little Nella-Rose could have. That conclusion reached, Truedale was
comforted. He could not lure his recent past to this environment,
but so long as it lay safe and ready to welcome him when he should
return, he could be content. So he relegated it with a resigned
sigh, as he might have done the memory of a dear, absent friend, to
the time when he could call it forth to some purpose.</p>
<p>It was well he could do this, for with the coming of Brace
Kendall upon the scene all romantic sensation was excluded as
though by an icy-clear, north wind. Brace was at the New York
station&mdash;Brace with the armour of familiarity and unbounded
friendliness. &ldquo;Old Top!&rdquo; he called Truedale, and shook
hands with him so vigorously that the last remnant of thought that
clung to the distant mountains was freed from the present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the miracles! Why, Con, I bet you tip the
scales at a hundred and sixty. And look at your paw! Why,
it&rsquo;s callous and actually horny! And the colour you&rsquo;ve
got! Lord, man! you&rsquo;re made over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to come to your uncle&rsquo;s house, Con.
It&rsquo;s rather a shock, but we got you as soon as we could. In
the meantime, we&rsquo;ve followed directions. The will has not
been read, of course, but there was a letter found in your
uncle&rsquo;s desk that commanded&mdash;that&rsquo;s the only word
to express it, really&mdash;Lynda and you and me to come to the old
house right after the funeral. We waited to hear from you, Con, but
since you could not get here we had to do the best we could. Dr.
McPherson took charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was buried pretty deep in the woods, Ken, and there was
a bad hitch in the delivery of the telegram. Such things do not
count down where I was. But I&rsquo;m glad about the old
house&mdash;glad you and Lynda are there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Con!&rdquo;&mdash;and at this Brace became
serious&mdash;&ldquo;I think we rather overdid our estimate of your
uncle. Since his&mdash;his going, we&rsquo;ve seen him, Lyn and I,
in a new light. He was quite&mdash;well, quite a sentimentalist!
But see&mdash;here we are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house looks different already!&rdquo; Conning said,
leaning from the cab window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Lyn&rsquo;s had a lot to do, but she&rsquo;s managed
to make a home of the place in the short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda Kendall had heard the sound of wheels in the quiet
street&mdash;had set the door of welcome open herself, and now
stood in the panel of light with outstretched hands. Like a
revelation Truedale seemed to take in the whole picture at once.
Behind the girl lay the warm, bright hall that had always been so
empty and drear in his boyhood. It was furnished now. Already it
had the look of having been lived in for years. There were flowers
in a tall jar on the table and a fire on the broad hearth. And
against this background stood the strong, fine form of the young
mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome home, Con!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale, for a moment, dared not trust his voice. He gripped
her hands and felt as if he were emerging from a trance. Then, of a
sudden, a deep resentment overpowered him. They could not
understand, of course, but every word and tone of appropriation
seemed an insult to the reality that he knew existed. He no longer
belonged to them, to the life into which they were trying to draw
him. To-morrow he would explain; he was eager to do so and end the
restraint that sprang into being the moment he touched
Lynda&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>Lynda watched the tense face confronting her and believed
Conning was suffering pangs of remorse and regret. She was filled
with pity and sympathy shone in her eyes. She led him to the
library and there familiarity greeted him&mdash;the room was
unchanged. Lynda had respected everything; it was as it always had
been except that the long, low chair was empty.</p>
<p>They talked together softly in the quiet place until
dinner&mdash;talked of indifferent things, realizing that they must
keep on the surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This room and his bedchamber, Con,&rdquo; Lynda
explained, &ldquo;are the same. For the rest? Well, I hope you will
like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale did like it. He gave an exclamation of delight when
later they entered the dining room, which had never been furnished
in the past; like much of the house it had been a sad tribute to
the emptiness and disappointment that had overcome William
Truedale&rsquo;s life. Now it shone with beauty and cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not merely a place in which to eat,&rdquo;
explained Lynda; &ldquo;a dining room should be the heart of the
home, as the library is the soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of living up to that!&rdquo;&mdash;Brace gave a
laugh&mdash;&ldquo;and not having it interfere with your
appetite!&rdquo; They were all trying to keep cheerful until such
time as they dared recall the recent past without restraint.</p>
<p>Such an hour came when they gathered once more in the library.
Brace seized his pipe in the anticipation of play upon his
emotions. By tacit consent the low chair was left vacant and by a
touch of imagination it almost seemed as if the absent master were
waiting to be justified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; Truedale said, huskily, &ldquo;tell me
all, Lynda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and I were sitting here just as we all are sitting
now, that last night. He had forgiven me for&mdash;for staying
away&rdquo; (Lynda&rsquo;s voice shook), &ldquo;and we were very
happy and confidential. I told him some things&mdash;quite intimate
things, and he, well, he came out of his reserve and gruffness,
Con&mdash;he let me see the real man he was! I suppose while he had
been alone&mdash;for I had neglected him&mdash;he had had time to
think, to regret his mistakes; he was very just&mdash;even with
himself. Con&rdquo;&mdash;and here Lynda had to pause and get
control of herself&mdash;&ldquo;he&mdash;he once loved my mother!
He bought this house hoping she would come and, as its mistress,
make it beautiful. When my mother married my father, nothing
mattered&mdash;nothing about the house, I mean. Before my mother
died she told me&mdash;to be kind to Uncle William. She, in a
sacred way, left him to me; me to him. That was one of the things I
told him that last night. I wish I had told him long ago!&rdquo;
The words were passionate and remorseful. &ldquo;Oh, it might have
eased his pain and loneliness. When shall we ever learn to say the
right thing when it is most needed? Well, after I had told him
he&mdash;he grew very still. It was a long time before he
spoke&mdash;the joy was sinking in, I saw that, and it carried the
bitterness away. When he did speak he made me understand that he
could not trust himself further on that subject, but he tried
to&mdash;to explain about you, Con. Poor man! He realized that he
had made a failure as a guide; but in his own way he had
endeavoured to be a guardian. You know his disease developed just
before you came into his life. Con, he lived all through the years
just for you&mdash;just to stand by!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From out the shadow where he sat, Brace spoke unevenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad you don&rsquo;t&mdash;smoke, old man!&rdquo; It
was the only suggestion he had to offer in the tense silence that
gripped them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; Truedale said heavily.
&ldquo;Go on when you can, Lynda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you&mdash;remember your father, Con?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, your uncle feared that too much ease and money
might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I begin to understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he went to the other extreme. Every step of your
well-fought way was joy to him&mdash;the only joy he knew. From his
detachment and loneliness he planned&mdash;almost plotted&mdash;for
you, but he did not tell you. It would all have been so
different&mdash;oh! so different if we had all known. Then he told
me a little&mdash;about his will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one saw the sudden crimson that dyed Lynda&rsquo;s white face
and throat. &ldquo;He was very fantastic about that. He made
certain arrangements that were to take effect at once. He has left
you three thousand a year, Con, without any restrictions whatever.
He told me that. He left his servants and employees generous
annuities. He left me this house&mdash;for my mother&rsquo;s sake.
He insisted that it should be a home at last. A large sum is
provided for its furnishing and upkeep&mdash;I&rsquo;m a trustee!
The most beautiful thing, perhaps, was the thought expressed in
these words of his, &lsquo;I want you to do your mother&rsquo;s
work and mine, while still following your own rightful desires.
Make this house a place of welcome, peace, and friendliness!&rsquo;
I mean to do my best, Con.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s left me&rdquo;&mdash;Brace found relief in
the one touch of humour that presented
itself&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s left me a thousand dollars as a
token of his appreciation of my loyalty to you, when you most
needed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Truedale hardly heeded. His eyes were fixed upon the empty
chair and, since he had not understood in the past, he could not
express himself now. He was suffering the torture that all feel
when, too late, revealment makes clear what never should have been
hidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&rdquo;&mdash;Lynda&rsquo;s low, even voice went
on&mdash;&ldquo;he sent me away and Thomas put him to bed. He asked
for some medicine that it seems he always had in case of need; he
took too much&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was suicide!&rdquo; Truedale broke in desperately.
&ldquo;I feared that. Good God!&rdquo; The tragedy and loneliness
clutched his imagination&mdash;he seemed to see it all, it was
unbearable!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Con!&rdquo; Lynda laid her firm hand upon his arm,
&ldquo;I have learned to call it something else. It has helped me;
perhaps it will help you. He had waited wearily on this side of the
door of release; he&mdash;he told me that he was going on a long
journey he had often contemplated&mdash;I did not understand then!
I fancy the&mdash;the journey was very short. There was no
suffering. I wish you could have seen the peace and majesty of his
face! He could wait no longer. Nothing mattered here, and all that
he yearned for called loudly to him. He simply opened the door
himself&mdash;and went out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale clasped the hand upon his arm. &ldquo;Thank you, Lynda.
I did not realize how kind you could be,&rdquo; was all he
said.</p>
<p>The logs fell apart and filled the room with a rich glow. Brace
shook the ashes from his pipe upon the hearth&mdash;he felt now
that he could trust himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the future,&rdquo; Lynda&rsquo;s calm voice almost
startled the two men by its practicability and purpose, &ldquo;this
is home&mdash;in the truest, biggest sense. No one shall even enter
here and feel&mdash;friendless. This is my trust; it shall be as
<i>he</i> wished it, and I mean to have my own life, too! Why, the
house is big enough for us all to live our lives and not interfere
with each other. I mean to bring my private business here in the
rooms over the extension. I&rsquo;ll keep the uptown office for
interviews. And you, Con?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale almost sprang to his feet, then, hands plunged in
pockets, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There does not seem to be anything for me to do; at least
not until the will is read. I think I shall go back&mdash;I left
things at loose ends; there will be time to
consider&mdash;later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Con, there is something for you to do. You will
understand after you see the lawyers in the morning. There is a
great deal of business: many interests of your uncle&rsquo;s that
he expected you to represent in his name&mdash;to see that they
were made secure. Dr. McPherson has told me something about the
will&mdash;enough to help me to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale looked blankly at Lynda. &ldquo;Very well, after
that&mdash;I will go back,&rdquo; he spoke almost harshly. &ldquo;I
will arrange affairs somehow. I&rsquo;m no business man, but I
daresay Uncle William chose wise assistants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, Con?&rdquo; Brace eyed
his friend critically; &ldquo;you look fit as a fellow can. This
has demanded a good deal of self-denial and faith from us all, but
somehow this duty was the biggest thing in sight; we rather owe him
that, I fancy. You know you cannot run to cover just now, old man.
This has been a jog, but by morning you&rsquo;ll reconsider and
play your part.&rdquo; There was a new note in Kendall&rsquo;s
voice. It was a call to something he hoped was in his friend, but
which he had never tested. There was a sudden fear, too, of the
change that had come to Truedale. It was not all physical. There
was a baffling suggestion of unreality about him that made him
almost a stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are right, Ken.&rdquo; Truedale walked the
length of the room and back. &ldquo;I own to being cut up over
this. I never did my part&mdash;I see that now&mdash;and of course
I&rsquo;ll endeavour to do what I should. My body&rsquo;s all right
but my nerves still jangle at a shock. To-morrow the whole thing
will settle into shape. You and Lynda have been&mdash;well&mdash;I
cannot express what I feel.&rdquo; He paused. The hour was late,
and for the first time he seemed to realize that the old home was
not his in the sense it once had been. Lynda understood the
moment&rsquo;s hesitation and smiled slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Con, there&rsquo;s one other thing in the house that
remains as it was. Under the eaves the small room that was yours is
yours still. I saw to it myself that not a book or picture was
displaced. There are other rooms at your disposal&mdash;to share
with us&mdash;but that room is yours, always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale stood before Lynda and put out his hands in quite the
old way. His eyes were dim and he said hoarsely:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the greatest thing you&rsquo;ve done yet,
Lyn. Thank you. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the door he hesitated&mdash;he felt he must speak, but to
bring his own affairs into the tense and new conditions surrounding
him seemed impossible. To-morrow he would explain everything. It
was this slowness in reaching a decision that most defeated
Truedale&rsquo;s best interest. While he deplored it&mdash;he
seemed incapable of overcoming it.</p>
<p>Alone in the little room, later, he let himself go. Burying his
tired head upon his folded arms he gave himself up to waves of
recollection that threatened to engulf him. Everything was as it
always had been&mdash;a glance proved that. When he had parted from
his uncle he had taken only such articles as pertained to his
maturer years. The pictures on the walls&mdash;the few shabby books
that had drifted into his lonely and misunderstood
childhood&mdash;remained. There was the locked box containing,
Conning knew full well, the pitiful but sacred attempts at
self-expression. The key was gone, but he recollected every scrap
of paper which lay hidden in the old, dented tin box. Presently he
went to the dormer window and opened it wide. Leaning out he tried
to find his way back to Pine Cone&mdash;to the future that was to
be free of all these cramping memories and hurting
restrictions&mdash;but the trail was too cluttered; he was lost
utterly!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is because they do not know,&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;After to-morrow it will be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he reflected that the three thousand dollars Lynda had
mentioned would clear every obstacle from his path and
Nella-Rose&rsquo;s. He no longer need struggle&mdash;he could give
his time and care to her and his work. He did not consider the rest
of his uncle&rsquo;s estate, it did not matter. Lynda was provided
for and so was he. And then, for the first time in many days,
Truedale speculated upon bringing Nella-Rose away from her hills.
He found himself rather insisting upon it, until he brought himself
to terms by remembering her as he had seen her last&mdash;clinging
to her own, vehemently, passionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve made my choice,&rdquo; he finally
exclaimed; &ldquo;the coming back unsettled me for the moment but
her people shall be my people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Below stairs Lynda was humming softly an old
tune&mdash;&ldquo;The Song of To-morrow,&rdquo; it was called. It
caught and held Truedale&rsquo;s imagination. He tried to recall
the lines, but only the theme was clear. It was the everlasting
Song of To-morrow, always the one tune set to changing ideals.</p>
<p>It was the same idea as the philosophy about each man&rsquo;s
&ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; of the story already written, which
Conning had reflected upon so often.</p>
<p>At this time Truedale believed he firmly accepted the principle
of foreordination, or whatever one chose to call it. One followed
the path upon which one&rsquo;s feet had been set. One might linger
and wander, within certain limits, but always each must return to
his destined trail!</p>
<p>A distant church clock struck one; the house was still at
last&mdash;deathly still. Two sounded, but Truedale thought on.</p>
<p>He finally succeeded in eliminating the entangling circumstances
that seemed to lie like a twisted skein in the years stretching
between his going forth from his uncle&rsquo;s house to this night
of return. He tried to understand himself, to estimate the man he
was. In no egotistical sense did he do this, but sternly,
deliberately, because he felt that the future demanded it. He must
account to others, but first he must account to himself.</p>
<p>He recalled his boyhood days when his uncle&rsquo;s distrust and
apparent dislike of him had driven him upon himself, almost taking
self-respect with it. He re-lived the barren years when, longing
for love and companionship, he found solace in a cold pride that
carried him along through school and into college, with a
reputation for hard, unyielding work, and unsocial habits.</p>
<p>How desperately lonely he had been&mdash;how cruelly
underestimated&mdash;but he had made no outcry. He had lived his
years uncomplainingly&mdash;not even voicing his successes and
achievements. Through long practise in self-restraint, his strength
lay in deliberate calculation&mdash;not indifferent action. He hid,
from all but the Kendalls, his private ambitions and hopes. He
studied in order that he might shake himself free from his
uncle&rsquo;s hold upon him. He meant to pay every cent he had
borrowed&mdash;to secure, by some position that would supply the
bare necessities of life, time and opportunity for developing the
talent he secretly believed was his. He was prepared, once loose
from obligation to old William Truedale, to starve and prove his
faith. And then&mdash;his breakdown had come!</p>
<p>Cast adrift by loss of health, among surroundings that appealed
to all that was most dangerous in his nature&mdash;believing that
his former ambitions were defeated&mdash;old longings for love,
understanding and self-revealment arose and conquered the weak
creature he was. But they had appealed to the best in him&mdash;not
the evillest&mdash;thank God! And now? Truedale raised his head and
looked about in the dim room, as if to find the boy he once had
been and reassure him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no longer any excuse for hesitation and the
damnable weakness of considering the next step,&rdquo; thought
Truedale. &ldquo;I have chosen my own course&mdash;chosen the
simple and best things life has to offer. No man in God&rsquo;s
world has a right to question my deeds. If they cannot understand,
more&rsquo;s the pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in that hour and conclusion, the indifference and false
pride that had upheld Truedale in the past fell from him as he
faced the demands of the morrow. He was never again to succumb to
the lack of confidence his desolate youth had developed; physically
and spiritually he roused to action now that exactions were made
upon him.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>The following day Truedale heard the will read. Directly after,
he felt like a man in a quicksand. Every thought and motion seemed
but to sink him deeper until escape appeared impossible.</p>
<p>He had felt, for a moment, a little surprise that the bulk of
his uncle&rsquo;s great fortune had gone to Dr. McPherson&mdash;an
already rich and prosperous man; then he began to understand.
Although McPherson was left free to act as he chose, there had
evidently been an agreement between him and William Truedale as to
the carrying out of certain affairs and, what was more startling
and embarrassing, Conning was hopelessly involved in these. Under
supervision, apparently, he was to be recognized as his
uncle&rsquo;s representative and, while not his direct heir,
certainly his respected nephew.</p>
<p>Truedale was confounded. Unless he were to disregard his
uncle&rsquo;s wishes, there was no way open for him but to
follow&mdash;as he was led. Far from being dissatisfied with the
distribution of the fortune, he had been relieved to know that he
was responsible for only a small part of it; but, on the other
hand, should he refuse to co&ouml;perate in the schemes outlined by
McPherson, he knew that he would be miserably misunderstood.</p>
<p>Confused and ill at ease he sought McPherson later in the day
and that genial and warm-hearted man, shrinking always behind so
stern an exterior that few comprehended him, greeted him almost
affectionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ordered six months for you, Truedale,&rdquo; he
exclaimed, viewing the result of his prescription keenly,
&ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve made good in a few weeks. You&rsquo;re a
great advertisement for Pine Cone. And White! Isn&rsquo;t he
God&rsquo;s own man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of him in just that
way&rdquo;&mdash;Conning reverted to his last memory of the
sheriff&mdash;&ldquo;but he probably showed another side to you. He
has a positive reverence for you and I imagine he accepted me as a
duty you had laid upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, boy! his health reports were eulogies&mdash;he
was your friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t he a freebooter with all his other
charms? His contempt for government, as we poor wretches know it,
is sublime; and yet he is the safest man I know. The law, he often
told me, was like a lie; useful only to scoundrels&mdash;torn-down
scoundrels, he called them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you it takes a God&rsquo;s man to run justice in
those hills! White&rsquo;s as simple and direct as a child and as
wise as a judge ought to be. I wouldn&rsquo;t send some folk I know
to White, they might blur his vision; but I could trust him to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently Truedale contemplated this image of White; then, as
McPherson talked on, the dead uncle materialized so differently
from the stupid estimate he had formed of him that a sense of shame
overpowered him. Lynda had somewhat opened Truedale&rsquo;s eyes,
but Lynda&rsquo;s love and compassion unconsciously coloured the
picture she drew. Here was a hard-headed business man, a man who
had been close to William Truedale all his life, proving him now,
to his own nephew, as a far-sighted, wise, even patient and
merciful friend.</p>
<p>Never had Truedale felt so small and humble. Never had his past
indifference and false pride seemed so despicable and
egotistical&mdash;his return for the silent confidence reposed in
him, so pitifully shameful.</p>
<p>He must bear his part now! There was no way but that! If he were
ever to regain his own self-respect or hope to hold that of others,
he must, to the exclusion of private inclination, rise as far as in
him lay to the demands made upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your uncle,&rdquo; McPherson was saying, &ldquo;tied hand
and foot as he was, looked far and wide during his years of
illness. I thought I knew, thought I understood him; but since his
death I have almost felt that he was inspired. It&rsquo;s a
damnable pity that our stupidity and callousness prevent us
realizing in life what we are quick enough to perceive in
death&mdash;when it is too late! Truedale&rsquo;s faith in me, when
I gave him so little to go by, is both flattering and touching. He
knew he could trust me&mdash;and that knowledge is the best thing
he bequeathed to me. But I expect you to do your part, boy, and by
so doing to justify much that might, otherwise, be questioned. To
begin with, as you have just heard, the sanatorium for cases like
your uncle&rsquo;s is to be begun at once. Now there is a strip of
land, which, should it suit our purpose, can be had at great
advantage if taken at once, and for cash. We will run down to see
it this week and then we&rsquo;ll know better where we
stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like,&rdquo; Truedale coloured quickly,
&ldquo;to return to Pine Cone for a few days. I could start at
once. You see I left rather suddenly and brought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But McPherson laughed and waved his hand in the wide gesture
that disposed of hope and fear, lesser business and even death
itself, at times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Jim won&rsquo;t tamper with anything. Certainly your
traps are safe enough there. Such things can wait, but this
land-deal cannot. Besides there are men to see: architects,
builders, etc. The wishes of your uncle were most explicit. The
building, you recall, was to be begun within three months of his
death. Having all the time there was, himself, he has left precious
little for others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the big laugh and wide gesture disposed of Pine Cone and
the tragic affairs of little Nella-Rose. Unless he was ready to lay
bare his private reasons, Truedale saw he must wait a few days
longer. And he certainly had no intention of confiding in
McPherson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, doctor,&rdquo; he said after a slight pause,
&ldquo;set me to work. I want you to know that as far as I can I
mean&mdash;too late, as you say&mdash;to prove my good intentions
at least to&mdash;my uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk!&rdquo; McPherson rose and
slapped Conning on the back. &ldquo;I used to say to old Truedale,
that if he had taken you more into his confidence, he might have
eased life for us all; but he was timid, boy, timid. In many ways
he was like a woman&mdash;a woman hurt and sensitive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had only known&mdash;only imagined&rdquo;; Conning
was walking toward the door; &ldquo;well, at least I&rsquo;m on the
job now, Dr. McPherson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then for an hour or two Truedale walked the city streets
perplexed and distraught. He was being absorbed without his own
volition. By a subtle force he was convinced that he was part of a
scheme bigger and stronger than his own desires and inclinations.
Unless he was prepared to play a coward&rsquo;s r&ocirc;le he must
adjust his thoughts and ideas to coincide with the rules and
regulations of the game of life and men. With this knowledge other
and more blighting convictions held part. In his defiance and
egotism he had muddled things in a desperate way. In the cold,
clear light of conventional relations the past few weeks, shorn of
the glamour cast by his romantic love and supposed contempt for
social restrictions, stood forth startlingly significant. At the
moment Truedale could not conceive how he had ever been capable of
playing the fool as he had! Not for one instant did this
realization affect his love and loyalty to Nella-Rose; but that he
should have been swept from his moorings by passion, reduced him to
a state of contempt for the folly he had perpetrated. And, he
thought, if he now, after a few days, could so contemplate his acts
how could he suppose that others would view them with tolerance and
sympathy?</p>
<p>No; he must accept the inevitable results of his action. His
love, his earnest intention of some day living his own life in his
own way, were to cost him more than he, blinded by selfishness and
passion in the hills, had supposed.</p>
<p>Well, he was ready to pay to the uttermost though it cost him
the deepest heart-ache. As he was prepared to undertake the burden
his uncle&rsquo;s belief in him entailed, so he was prepared, now
that he saw things clearly, to forego the dearest and closest ties
of his old life.</p>
<p>He wondered how he could ever have dreamed that he could go to
Lynda and Brace with his amazing confession and expect them, in the
first moment of shock, to open their hearts and understand him. He
almost laughed, now, as he pictured the absurdity. And just then he
drew himself up sharply and came to his conclusion.</p>
<p>He could not lay himself bare to any one as a sentimental ass;
he must arrange things as soon as possible to return South; he
would, just before starting, tell Lynda and Brace of his attachment
for Nella-Rose. They would certainly understand why, in the stress
and strain of recent events, he had not intruded his startling news
before. He would neither ask nor expect sympathy or
co&ouml;peration. He must assume that they could not comprehend
him. This was going to be the hardest wrench of his life, Truedale
recognized that, but it was the penalty he felt he must pay.</p>
<p>Then he would go&mdash;for his wife! He would secure her
privately, by all the necessary conventions he had spurned so
madly&mdash;he would bring her to his people and leave to her
sweetness and tender charm the winning of that which he, in his
blindness, had all but lost.</p>
<p>So, in this mood, he returned to his uncle&rsquo;s house and
wrote a long letter to Nella-Rose. He phrased it simply, as to a
little child. He reminded her of the old story she had once told
him of her belief that some day she was to do a mighty big
thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you have your chance!&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;I
cannot live in your hills, dear, though often you and I will return
to them and be happy in the little log house. But you must come
with me&mdash;your husband. Come down the Big Road, letting me lead
you, and you must trust me and oh! my doney-gal, by your blessed
sweetness and power you must win for me&mdash;for us
both&mdash;what I, alone, can never win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was more, much more, of love and longing, of tender
loyalty and passionate reassurance, and having concluded his letter
he sealed it, addressed it, and putting it in an envelope with a
short note of explanation to Jim White as to its delivery, etc., he
mailed it with such a sense of relief as he had not known in many a
weary day.</p>
<p>He prepared himself for a period of patient waiting. He knew
with what carelessness mail matter was regarded in the hills, and
winter had already laid its hold upon Pine Cone, he felt sure. So
while he waited he plunged eagerly into each day&rsquo;s work and
with delight saw how everything seemed to go through without a
hitch. It began to look as if, when Nella-Rose&rsquo;s reply came,
there would be no reason for delay in bringing her to the
North.</p>
<p>But this hope and vision did not banish entirely
Truedale&rsquo;s growing sorrow for the part he must inevitably
take when the truth was known to Lynda and Brace. Harder and harder
the telling of it appeared as the time drew near. Never had they
seemed dearer or more sacred to him than now when he realized the
hurt he must cause them. There were moments when he felt that he
could not bear the eyes of Lynda&mdash;those friendly, trusting
eyes. Would she ever be able, in the years to come, to forgive and
forget? And Brace&mdash;how could that frank, direct nature
comprehend the fever of madness that had, in the name of love,
betrayed the confidence and faith of a lifetime? Well, much lay in
the keeping of the little mountain girl whose fascination and
loveliness would plead mightily. Of Nella-Rose&rsquo;s power
Truedale held no doubt.</p>
<p>Then came White&rsquo;s devastating letter at the close of an
exhausting day when Conning was to dine with the Kendalls.</p>
<p>That afternoon he had concluded the immediate claims of
business, had arranged with McPherson for a week&rsquo;s absence,
and meant in the evening to explain to Brace and Lynda the reason
for his journey. He was going to start South on the morrow, whether
a letter came or not. He had steeled himself for the crucial hour
with his friends; had already, in his imagination, bidden farewell
to the relations that had held them close through the past years.
He believed, because he was capable of paying this heavy price for
his love, that no further proof would be necessary to convince even
Lynda of its intensity.</p>
<p>They dined cheerfully and alone and, as they crossed the hall
afterward, to the library, Lynda asked casually:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get the letters for you, Con? The maid laid them
on the stand by the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she went on into the bright room with its long, vacant
chair, singing &ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s Song&rdquo; in that sweet
contralto of hers that deserved better training.</p>
<p>There were three letters&mdash;one from a man whose son Truedale
had tutored before he went away, one from the architect of the new
hospital, and a bulky one from Dr. McPherson. Truedale carried them
all into the library where Brace sat comfortably puffing away
before the fire; and Lynda, some designs for interior decoration
spread out before her on a low table, still humming, rocked gently
to and fro in a very feminine rocker. Conning drew up a chair
opposite Kendall and tore open the envelope from his late
patron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Brace,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if any one had
told me six weeks ago that I should ever be indifferent to a
possible offer to tutor, I would have laughed at him. But so it is.
I must turn down the sure-paying Mr. Smith for lack of
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda laughed merrily. &ldquo;And six weeks ago if any one had
come to me in my Top Shelf where I carried on my profession, and
outlined this for me&rdquo;&mdash;she waved her hand around the
room&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have called the janitor to put out an
unsafe person. Hey-ho!&rdquo; And then the brown head was bent over
the problem of an order which had come in that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I say, Lyn!&rdquo; Truedale turned from his second
letter. &ldquo;Morgan suggests that <i>you</i> attend to the
decorating and furnishing of the hospital. I told him to choose his
man and he prefers you if I have no objection. Objection? Good
Lord, I never thought of you. I somehow considered such work out of
your line, but I&rsquo;m delighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; Lynda looked up, radiant. &ldquo;How I
shall revel in those broad, clean spaces! How I shall see Uncle
William in every room! Thank him, Con, and tell him I
accept&mdash;on his terms!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Truedale opened the third envelope and an enclosed letter
fell out, bearing the postmark of the Junction near Pine Cone!</p>
<p>There was a small electric reading lamp on the arm of
Truedale&rsquo;s chair; he turned the light on and, while his face
was in shadow, the words before him stood out illumined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir&mdash;Mister Truedale.&rdquo; The sheriff had
evidently been sorely perplexed as to the proper beginning of the
task he had undertaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I send this by old Doc McPherson, not knowing any better
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Jim&rsquo;s epistle was nearly innocent of punctuation, his
words ran on almost unbroken and gave the reader some trouble in
following.)</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Your letter to a certain young person has come and been
destroyed owing to my thinking under the present circumstances,
some folks what don&rsquo;t know about you, better not hear now. I
took the letter to Lone Dome as you set down for me to do meaning
to give it to Nella-Rose like what you said, but she wasn&rsquo;t
there. Pete was there and Marg&mdash;she&rsquo;s Nella-Rose&rsquo;s
sister, and getting ready to marry that torn-down scamp Jed Martin
which to my way of thinking is about the best punishment what could
be dealt out to him. Pete was right sober for him and spruced up
owing to facts I am now coming to and when Pete&rsquo;s sober there
ain&rsquo;t a more sensible cuss than what he is nor a gentlemaner.
Well, I asked natural like for Nella-Rose and Marg scrooged up her
mouth, knowing full well as how I knew Jed was second choice for
her&mdash;but Pete he done tell me that Nella-Rose had married
Burke Lawson and run to safer parts and when I got over the shock I
was certainly thankful for being a sheriff ain&rsquo;t all it might
be when your ideas of justice and liking gets crossed. I
didn&rsquo;t ask any more questions. Peter was sober&mdash;he only
lies when he&rsquo;s drunk and not having any wish to rouse Marg I
just come away and burned the letter what you sent. But I&rsquo;ve
done some thinking on my own &rsquo;count since your letter came
and I reckon I&rsquo;ve studied the thing clear on circumstantial
evidence which is what I mostly have to go on in the sticks. I
certainly done you a black insult that day I came upon you and
Nella-Rose. I didn&rsquo;t let on, and I never will, about her
being to my place, but no wonder the poor child was terrible upset
when I came in. She had come to me, so I study out, and found
you&mdash;stark stranger! How you ever soothed the poor little
thing I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;her being wild as a flea&mdash;but
on top of that, in I slam and lit out on you both and &rsquo;corse
she couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;splain about Burke before you and
that&rsquo;s plain enough what she had come to do, and I
didn&rsquo;t leave either one of you a leg to stand on. I&rsquo;ve
been pretty low in my spirits I can tell you and I beg your pardon
humble, young feller, and if ever I can do Nella-Rose a turn by
letting Burke free, no matter what he does&mdash;I will! But
&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t likely he&rsquo;ll act up for some time.
Nella-Rose always could tame him and he&rsquo;s been close on her
trail ever since she was a toddler. I&rsquo;m right glad they took
things in their own hands and left. She didn&rsquo;t sense the
right black meaning I had in my heart that day when she
ran&mdash;but you did and I sure am ashamed of the part I done
played.</p>
<p>If you can overlook what no man has a call to overlook in
another&mdash;your welcome is red hot here for you at any time.</p>
<p>JIM WHITE</p>
<p>Sheriff.</p>
</div>
<p>Truedale read and reread this amazing production until he began
to feel his way through the tangle of words and catch a
meaning&mdash;false, ridiculously false of course, but none the
less designed as an explanation and excuse. Then the non-essentials
dropped away and one bald fact remained! Truedale sank back in his
chair, turned off the electric light, and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired, old man?&rdquo; Kendall asked from across the
hearth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Dead tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll travel easier when you get the
gait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a bit of a nap,&rdquo; Lynda suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Lyn, I will.&rdquo; Then Truedale, safe from
intrusion, tried to make his way out of the maze into which he had
been thrown. Slowly he recovered from the effect of the staggering
blow and presently got to the point where he felt it was all a
cruel lie or a stupid jest. There he paused. Jim was not the kind
to lie or joke about such a thing. It was a mistake&mdash;surely a
mistake. He would go at once to Pine Cone and make everything
right. Nella-Rose could not act alone. Tradition, training,
conspired to unfit her for this crisis; but that she had gone from
his love and faith into the arms of another man was incredible. No;
she was safe, probably in hiding; she would write him. She had the
address&mdash;she was keen and quick, even though she was helpless
to cope with the lawlessness of her mountain environment. Truedale
saw the necessity of caution, not for himself, but for Nella-Rose.
He could not go, unaided, to search for her. Evidently there had
been wild doings after he left; no one but White and Nella-Rose
knew of his actual existence&mdash;he must utilize White in
assisting him, but above all he must expect that Nella-Rose would
make her whereabouts known. Never for a moment did he doubt her or
put any credence in the conclusions White had drawn. How little Jim
really knew! By to-morrow word would come from Nella-Rose; somehow
she would manage, once she was safe from being followed, to get to
the station and telegraph. But there could be no leaving the girl
in the hills after this; he must, as soon as he located her, bring
her away; bring her into his life&mdash;to his home and hers!</p>
<p>A cold sweat broke out on Truedale&rsquo;s body as he lashed
himself unmercifully in the still room where his two friends, one
believing him asleep, waited for his awakening.</p>
<p>Well, he was awake at last, thank God! The only difference
between him and a creature such as good men and women abhor was
that he meant to retrieve, as far as in him lay, the past error and
injustice. All his future life should prove his purpose. And then,
like a sweet fragrance or a spirit touch, his love pleaded for him.
He had been weak, but not vicious. The unfettered life had clouded
his reason, and his senses had played him false, but love was
untarnished&mdash;and it <i>was</i> love. That girl of the hills
was the same now as she had always been. She would accept him and
his people and he would make her life such that, once the
homesickness for the hills was past, she would have no regrets.</p>
<p>Then another phase held Truedale&rsquo;s thought. In that day
when Nella-Rose accepted, in the fullest sense, his people and his
people&rsquo;s code&mdash;how would he stand in her eyes? A groan
escaped him, then another, and he started nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Con, what is it&mdash;a bad dream?&rdquo; Lynda touched
his arm to arouse him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;a mighty bad one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell it to me. Tell it while it is fresh in your mind.
They say once you have put a dream in words, its effect is killed
forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale turned dark, sorrowful eyes upon Lynda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wish I could tell it,&rdquo; he said with a
seriousness that made her laugh, &ldquo;but it was the kind that
eludes&mdash;words. The creeping, eating impression&mdash;sort of
nightmare. Good Lord! how nerves play the deuce with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brace Kendall did not speak. From his place he had been watching
Truedale, for the firelight had betrayed the truth. Truedale had
not been sleeping: Truedale had been terribly upset by that last
letter of his!</p>
<p>And just then Conning leaned forward and threw his entire mail
upon the blazing logs!</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>For Truedale to await, calmly, further developments was out of
the question. He did, however, force himself to act as sanely as
possible. He felt confident that Nella-Rose, safely hidden and
probably enjoying it in her own elfish way, would communicate with
him in a few days at the latest, now that things had, according to
White, somewhat settled into shape after the outlaw Lawson had
taken himself off the scene.</p>
<p>To get to the station and telegraph would mean quite a feat for
Nella-Rose at any time, and winter was in all likelihood already
gripping the hills. To write and send a letter might be even more
difficult. So Truedale reasoned; so he feverishly waited, but he
was not idle. He rented a charming little suite of rooms, high up
in a new apartment house, and begged Lynda to set them in order at
once. Somehow he believed that in the years ahead, after she
understood, Lynda would be glad that he had asked this from
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why the hurry, Con?&rdquo; she naturally questioned;
&ldquo;if people are going to be so spasmodic I&rsquo;ll have to
get a partner. It may be all right, looked at financially, but
it&rsquo;s the ruination of art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is a special case, Lyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all special cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is a&mdash;welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for me! You see I&rsquo;ve never had a real home,
Lyn. It&rsquo;s one of the luxuries I&rsquo;ve always dreamed
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had thought,&rdquo; Lynda&rsquo;s clear eyes clouded,
&ldquo;that your uncle&rsquo;s house would be your home at last. It
is big enough for us all&mdash;we need not run against each
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep my room under the roof, Lyn.&rdquo; Truedale looked
at her yearningly and she&mdash;misunderstood! &ldquo;I shall often
come to that&mdash;to you and Brace&mdash;but humour me in this
fancy of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she humoured him&mdash;working early and late&mdash;putting
more of her own heart in it than he was ever to know, for she
believed&mdash;poor girl&mdash;that he would offer it to her some
day and then&mdash;when he found out about the money&mdash;how
exactly like a fairy tale it all would be! And Lynda had had so few
fairy tales in her life.</p>
<p>And while she designed and Conning watched and suggested, they
talked of his long-neglected work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have time soon, Con, to give it your best
thought. Did you do much while you were away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Lyn, a great deal!&rdquo; Truedale was sitting by
the tiny hearth in his diminutive living room. He and Lynda had
demanded, and finally succeeded in obtaining an open space for real
logs; disdaining, much to the owner&rsquo;s amazement, an asbestos
mat or gas monstrosity. &ldquo;I really put blood in the
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when may I hear some of it? I&rsquo;m wild to get
back to our beaten tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale raised his eyes, but he was looking beyond Lynda; he
was seeing Nella-Rose in the nest he was preparing for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon, Lyn. Soon. And when you do&mdash;you, of all the
world, will understand, sympathize, and approve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Con, thank you. Of course I will, but it is
good to have you know it! Let me see, what colour scheme shall we
introduce in the living room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we have a sort of blue-gray; a rather
smoky tint with sunshine in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Con! And it is a north room,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, how about a misty, whitish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse and worse. Con, in a north room there must be
warmth and real colour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be. But put what you choose, Lyn, it will
surely be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose, then, we make it golden brown, or&mdash;dull,
soft reds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale recalled the shabby little shawl that Nella-Rose had
worn before she donned her winter disguise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it soft dull red, Lyn&mdash;but not <i>too</i>
dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale no longer meant to lay his secret bare before departing
for the South. While he would not acknowledge it to his anxious
heart, he realized that he must base the future on the outcome of
his journey. Once he laid hands upon Nella-Rose, he would act
promptly and hopefully, but&mdash;he must be sure, now, before he
made a misstep. There had been mistakes enough, heaven knew; he
must no longer play the fool.</p>
<p>And then when the little gilded cage was ready, Truedale
conceived his big and desperate idea. Two weeks had passed since
Jim White&rsquo;s letter and no telegram or note had come from
Nella-Rose. Neither love nor caution could wait longer. Truedale
decided to go to Pine Cone. Not as a returned traveller, certainly
not&mdash;at first&mdash;to White, but to Lone Dome, and there,
passing himself off as a chance wayfarer, he would gather as much
truth as he could, estimate the value of it, and upon it take his
future course. In all probability, he thought&mdash;and he was
almost gay now that he was about to take matters into his own
hands&mdash;he would ferret out the real facts and be back with his
quarry before another week. It was merely a matter of getting the
truth and being on the spot.</p>
<p>Nella-Rose&rsquo;s family might, for reasons of their own, have
deceived Jim White. Certainly if they did not know at the time of
Nella-Rose&rsquo;s whereabouts they would, like others, voice the
suspicion of the hills; but by now they would either have her with
them or know positively where she was. For all his determination to
believe this, Truedale had his moments of sickening doubt. The
simple statement in White&rsquo;s letter, burned, as time went on,
into his very soul.</p>
<p>But, whatever came&mdash;whatever there was to know&mdash;he
meant to go at once to headquarters. He would remain, too, until
Peter Greyson was sober enough to state facts. He recalled clearly
Jim&rsquo;s estimate of Greyson and his dual nature depending so
largely upon the effect of the mountain whisky.</p>
<p>It was late November when Truedale set forth. No one made any
objection to his going now. Things were running smoothly and if he
had to go at all to straighten out any loose ends, he had better go
at once.</p>
<p>To Lynda the journey seemed simple enough. Truedale had left,
among other belongings, his manuscript and books. Naturally he
would not trust them to another&rsquo;s careless handling.</p>
<p>At Washington, Truedale bought a rough tramping rig and
continued his journey with genuine enjoyment of the adventure. Now
that he was nearing the scene of his past experience he could
better understand the delay. Things moved so slowly among the hills
and naturally Nella-Rose, trusting and fond, was part of the
sluggish life. How she would show her small, white teeth when,
smiling in his arms, she told him all about it! It would not take
long to make her forget the weary time of absence and White&rsquo;s
misconception.</p>
<p>Truedale proceeded by deliberate stages. He wanted to gather all
he possibly could as a foundation upon which to build. The first
day after he left the train at the station&mdash;and it had bumped
at the end of the rails just as it had on his previous
trip&mdash;he walked to the Centre and there encountered
Merrivale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, stranger,&rdquo; the old man inquired, &ldquo;whar
yer goin&rsquo;, if it ain&rsquo;t askin&rsquo; too
much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Truedale expansively explained. He was tramping through the
mountains for pure enjoyment; had heard of the hospitality he might
expect and meant to test it.</p>
<p>Merrivale was pleased but cautious. He was full of questions
himself, but ran to cover every time his visitor ventured one.
Truedale soon learned his lesson and absorbed what was offered
without openly claiming more. He remained over night with Merrivale
and stocked up the next morning from the store.</p>
<p>He had heard much, but little to any purpose. He carried away
with him a pretty clear picture of Burke Lawson who, by
Merrivale&rsquo;s high favour, appeared heroic. The storm, the
search, Lawson&rsquo;s escape and supposed carrying off of
Nella-Rose, were the chief topics of conversation. Merrivale
chuckled in delight over this.</p>
<p>The afternoon of the second day Truedale reached Lone Dome and
came upon Peter, sober and surprisingly respectable, sunning
himself on the west side of the house.</p>
<p>The first glance at the stately old figure, gone to decay like a
tree with dead rot, startled and amazed Truedale and he thanked
heaven that the master of Lone Dome was himself and therefore to be
relied upon; no one could possibly suspect Peter of cunning or
deceit in his present condition.</p>
<p>Greyson greeted the stranger cordially. He was in truth
desperately forlorn and near the outer edge of endurance. An hour
more and he would have defied the powers that had recently taken
control of him, and made for the still in the deep woods; but the
coming of Truedale saved him from that and diverted his tragic
thoughts.</p>
<p>The fact was Marg and Jed had gone away to be married. Owing to
the death of the near-by minister in the late storm, they had to
travel a considerable distance in order to begin life according to
Marg&rsquo;s strict ideas of propriety. Before leaving she had
impressed upon her father the necessity of his keeping a clear head
in her absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-all may be gone days, father,&rdquo; she had said,
&ldquo;and yo&rsquo; certainly do drop in owdacious places when
you&rsquo;re drunk. Yo&rsquo; might freeze or starve. Agin, a
lurking beast, hunting fo&rsquo; food, might chaw yo&rsquo;
fo&rsquo; yo&rsquo; got yo&rsquo; senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something of this Greyson explained to his guest while setting
forth the evening meal and apologizing for the lack of
stimulant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being her marriage trip I let Marg have her way and a
mind free o&rsquo; worry &rsquo;bout me. But women don&rsquo;t
understand, God bless &rsquo;em! What&rsquo;s a drop in yo&rsquo;
own home? But fo&rsquo; she started forth Marg spilled every jug
onto the wood pile. When I see the flames extry sparkling I know
the reason!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greyson chuckled, walking to and fro from table to pantry, with
steady, almost dignified strides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Truedale hastened to say,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather inclined to agree with your daughter;
and&mdash;&rdquo; raising the concoction Peter had
evolved&mdash;&ldquo;this tea&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me! This coffee goes right to the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ate and grew confidential. Edging close, but keeping under
cover, Truedale gained the confidence of the lonely, broken man
and, late in the evening, the hideous truth, as Truedale was
compelled to believe, was in his keeping.</p>
<p>For an hour Greyson had been nodding and dozing; then,
apologetically, rousing. Truedale once suggested bed, but for some
unexplainable reason Peter shrank from leaving his guest. Then,
risking a great deal, Truedale asked nonchalantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you other children besides this daughter who is on
her wedding trip? It&rsquo;s rather hard&mdash;leaving you alone to
shift for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greyson was alert. Not only did he share the mountain
dweller&rsquo;s wariness of question, but he instantly conceived
the idea that the stranger had heard gossip and he was in arms to
defend his own. His ancestors, who long ago had shielded the
recreant great-aunt, were no keener than Peter now was to protect
and preserve the honour of the little girl who, by her recent
acts&mdash;and Greyson had only Jed&rsquo;s words and the mountain
talk to go by&mdash;had aroused in him all that was fine enough to
suffer. And Greyson was suffering as only a man can who, in a rare
period of sobriety, views the wrecks of his own making.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, as White truly supposed, Peter lied only when he was
drunk; but the sheriff could not estimate the vagaries of blood and
so, at Truedale&rsquo;s question, the father of Nella-Rose, with
the gesture inherited from a time of prosperity, rallied his forces
and lied! Lied like a gentleman, he would have said. Broken and
shabby as Greyson was, he appeared, at that moment, so simple and
direct, that his listener, holding to the sheriff&rsquo;s estimate,
was left with little doubt concerning what he heard. He, watching
the weak and agonized face, believed Greyson was making the best of
a sad business; but that he was weaving from whole cloth the
garment that must cover the past, Truedale in his own misery never
suspected. While he listened something died within him never to
live again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I have another daughter&mdash;lil&rsquo;
Nella-Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale shaded his face with his hand, but kept his eyes on
Greyson&rsquo;s distorted face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; Nella-Rose. I have to keep in mind her youth
and enjoying ways or I&rsquo;d be right hard on Nella-Rose.
Yo&rsquo; may have heard, while travelling about&mdash;o&rsquo;
Nella-Rose?&rdquo; This was asked nervously&mdash;searchingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heard that name,&rdquo;
Truedale ventured. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a name that&mdash;somehow
clings and, being a writer-man, everything interests me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Greyson gave an account of the trap episode tallying so
exactly with White&rsquo;s version that it established a firm
structure upon which to lay all that was to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there ain&rsquo;t nothing as can raise a
woman&rsquo;s tenderness and loyalty to a man,&ldquo; Greyson went
on, &rdquo;like getting into a hard fix, and sho&rsquo; Burke
Lawson was in a right bad fix.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to see it all now. Nella-Rose went to
Merrivale&rsquo;s and he told her Burke had come back. Merrivale
told me that. Naturally it upset her and she followed him up to
warn him. Think o&rsquo; that lil&rsquo; girl tracking &rsquo;long
the hills, through all that storm, to&mdash;to save the man she had
played with and flouted but loved, without knowing it! Nella-Rose
was like that. She lit on things and took her fun&mdash;but in the
big parts she always did come out strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale shifted his position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;m wearying you with my troubles?&rdquo;
Greyson spoke apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. Go on. This interests me very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, Burke Lawson and Jed Martin came on each other
in the deep woods the night of the big storm and Burke and Jed had
words and a scene. Jed owned up to that. It was life and death and
I ain&rsquo;t blaming any one and I have one thing to thank Burke
for&mdash;he might have done different and left a stain on a
lady&rsquo;s name, sir! He told Jed how he had seen Nella-Rose and
how she had scorned him for being a coward, but how she would take
her words back if he dared come out and show his head. And he
&rsquo;lowed he was going to come out then and there, which he did,
and he and Nella-Rose was going off to Cataract Falls where the
Lawsons hailed from, on the mother&rsquo;s side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;how do you know that your daughter kept her
word? This Lawson may have been obliged to make away with
himself&mdash;alone.&rdquo; Truedale grew more daring. He saw that
Greyson, absorbed by his trouble, was less on guard. But Greyson
was keenly observant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s heard the gossip,&rdquo; thought the old man,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s ringing through the hills. Well, a dog as can
fetch a bone can carry one!&rdquo; With that conclusion reached,
Peter made his master stroke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard from her,&rdquo; he half whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard from her?&rdquo; gasped Truedale, and even then
Greyson seemed unaware of the attitude of the stranger.
&ldquo;How&mdash;did you hear from her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wrote and sent the letter long of&mdash;of Bill Trim,
a half-wit&mdash;but trusty. Nella-Rose went with Lawson&mdash;she
&rsquo;lowed she had to. He came on her in the woods and held her
to her word. She said as how she wanted to&mdash;to come home, but
Lawson set forth as how an hour might mean his life&mdash;and put
it up to lil&rsquo; Nella-Rose! He&mdash;he swore as how he&rsquo;d
shoot himself if she didn&rsquo;t go with him&mdash;and it was like
Burke to do it. He was always crazy mad for Nella-Rose, and there
ain&rsquo;t anything he wouldn&rsquo;t do when he got balked.
She&mdash;she had ter go&mdash;or see Lawson kill himself; so she
went&mdash;but asked my pardon fo&rsquo; causing the deep trouble.
Lawson married her at the first stopping place over the ridge. He
ain&rsquo;t worthy o&rsquo; my lil&rsquo; Nella-Rose&mdash;but
us-all has got to make the best o&rsquo; it. Come
spring&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be back, and then&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
forgive her&mdash;my lil&rsquo; Nella-Rose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the intensity of his emotions Greyson trembled and the weak
tears ran down his lined face. Taking advantage of the tense moment
Truedale asked desperately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you show me that letter, Mr. Greyson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So direct was the request, so apparently natural to the old
man&rsquo;s unguarded suffering, that it drove superficialities
before it and merely confirmed Greyson in his determination to save
Nella-Rose&rsquo;s reputation at any cost. Ignoring the
unwarrantable curiosity, alert to the necessity of quick defense,
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. I wish to Gawd I could and then I could
stop any tongue what dares to tech my lil&rsquo; gal&rsquo;s
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can you not show me the letter?&rdquo; Truedale was
towering above the old man. By some unknown power he had got
control of the situation. &ldquo;I have a reason for&mdash;asking
this, Mr. Greyson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marg burned it! It was allus Marg or lil&rsquo;
Nella-Rose for Lawson, and Nella-Rose got him! When Marg knew this
fur certain, there was no length to which she&mdash;didn&rsquo;t
go! This is my home, sir; I&rsquo;m old&mdash;Marg is a good girl
and the trouble is past now; her and Jed is making me comfortable,
but we-all don&rsquo;t mention Nella-Rose. It eases me, though, to
tell the truth for lil&rsquo; Nella-Rose. I know how the tongues
are wagging and I have to sit still fo&rsquo;&mdash;since Marg and
Jed took up with each other&mdash;my future lies &rsquo;long
o&rsquo; them. I&rsquo;m an old man and mighty dependent; time was
when&mdash;&rdquo; Greyson rose unsteadily and swayed toward the
fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gawd a&rsquo;mighty!&rdquo; he flung out desperately,
&ldquo;how I want&mdash;whisky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale saw the wildness in the old man&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;saw
the trembling and twitching of the outstretched hands, and feared
what might be the result of trouble and enforced sobriety. He
pulled a large flask from his pocket and offered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take a swallow of this and
pull yourself together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greyson, with a cry, seized the liquor and drained every drop
before Truedale could control him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless yo&rsquo;!&rdquo; whined Greyson, sinking back
into his chair, &ldquo;bless and&mdash;and keep
yo&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale dared not leave the house though his soul recoiled from
the sight before him. He waited an hour, watching the effect of the
stimulant. Greyson grew mellow after a time&mdash;at peace with the
world; he smiled foolishly and became maudlinly familiar. Finally,
Truedale approached him again. He bent over him and shook him
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell me&mdash;the
truth&mdash;about&mdash;Nella-Rose?&rdquo; he whispered to the
sagging, blear-eyed creature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; moaned Peter, &ldquo;I sho&rsquo;
did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Truedale did not reflect that when Greyson
was-drunk&mdash;he lied!</p>
<p>Truedale never recalled clearly how he spent the hours between
the time he left Greyson&rsquo;s until he knocked on the door of
White&rsquo;s cabin; but it was broad daylight and bitingly cold
when Jim flung the door open and looked at the stranger with no
idea, for a moment, that he had ever seen him before. Then, putting
his hand out wonderingly, he muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gawd!&rdquo; and drew Truedale in. Breakfast was spread
on the table; the dogs lay before the blazing fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat!&rdquo; commanded Jim, &ldquo;and keep yer jaws shet
except to put in food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conning attempted the feat but made a pitiful showing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to stay on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>White&rsquo;s curiosity was betraying him and the sympathy in
his eyes filled Truedale with a mad desire to take this
&ldquo;God&rsquo;s man&rdquo; into his confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jim. I&rsquo;ve come to pack and go back to&mdash;to
my job!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! it can&rsquo;t be much of a job if you can tackle
it&mdash;lookin&rsquo; like what you do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been tramping for&mdash;for days, old man!
Rather overdone the thing. I&rsquo;m not so bad as I
look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it!&rdquo; laconically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put up with you to-night, Jim, if you&rsquo;ll
take me in.&rdquo; Truedale made an effort to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provin&rsquo; there ain&rsquo;t any hard
feeling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There never was, White. I&mdash;understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They got through the day somehow. The crust was forming over
Truedale&rsquo;s suffering; he no longer had any desire to let even
White break through it. Once, during the afternoon, the sheriff
spoke of Nella-Rose and without flinching Truedale listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That gal will have Burke eatin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; her
hand in no time. Lawson is all right at the kernel, all he needed
was some one ter steady him. Once I made sure he&rsquo;d married
the gal, I felt right easy in my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;did make sure, Jim? There was no doubt?
I&mdash;I remember the pretty little thing; it would have been
damnable to&mdash;to hurt her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scrooged the main fact out o&rsquo; old Pete, her
father. There was a mighty lot o&rsquo; talk in the hills, but I
was glad ter get the facts and shut the mouths o&rsquo; them that
take ter&mdash;ter hissin&rsquo; like all-fired scorpions!
Nella-Rose had writ to her father, but Marg, the sister, tore the
letter up in stormin&rsquo; rage &rsquo;cause Nella-Rose had got
the man she had sot her feelin&rsquo;s on. Do you happen to call
ter mind what I once told you &rsquo;bout those two gals and a
little white hen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same old actin&rsquo; up!&rdquo; Jim went on. &ldquo;But
when Greyson let out what war in the letter&mdash;knowin&rsquo;
Burke like what I do&mdash;I studied it out cl&rsquo;ar enough.
Nella-Rose was sure up agin blood and thunder whatever way
yo&rsquo; put it&mdash;so she ran her chances with Burke. There
ain&rsquo;t much choosin&rsquo; fo&rsquo; women in the hills and
Burke is an owdacious fiery feller, an&rsquo; he ain&rsquo;t ever
set his mind to no woman but Nella-Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night Truedale went to his old cabin. He built a fire on
the hearth, drew the couch before it, and then the battle was
on&mdash;the fierce, relentless struggle. In it&mdash;Nella-Rose
escaped. Like a bit of the mist that the sun burns, so she was
purified&mdash;consumed by the fire of Truedale&rsquo;s remorse and
shame. Not for a moment did he let the girl bear a shadow of
blame&mdash;he was done with that forever!&mdash;but he held
himself before the judgment seat of his own soul and he passed
sentence upon himself in terms that stern morality has evolved for
its own protection. But from out the wreck and ruin Truedale
wrenched one sacred truth to which he knew he must hold&mdash;or
sink utterly. He could not expect any one in God&rsquo;s world to
understand; it must always be hidden in his own soul, but that
marriage of his and Nella-Rose&rsquo;s in the gray dawn after the
storm had been holy and binding to him. From now on he must look
upon the little mountain girl as a dear, dead wife&mdash;one whose
childish sweetness was part of a time when he had learned to laugh
and play, and forget the hard years that had gone to his un-making,
not his upbuilding.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>Truedale travelled back to the place of his new life bearing his
books, his unfinished play, and his secret sorrow with him. His
books and papers were the excuse for his journey; for the rest, no
one suspected nor&mdash;so thought Truedale&mdash;was any one ever
to know. That part of his life-story was done with; it had been
interpreted bunglingly and ignorantly to be sure, but the lesson,
learned by failure, had sunk deep in his heart.</p>
<p>He arranged his private work in the little room under the eaves.
He intended, if time were ever his again, to begin where he had
left off when broken health interrupted.</p>
<p>In the extension room over William Truedale&rsquo;s bedchamber
Lynda carried on her designing and her study; her office, uptown,
was reserved for interviews and outside business. Her home workshop
had the feminine touch that the other lacked. There were her tea
table by the hearth, work bags of dainty silk, and flowers in glass
vases. The dog and the cats were welcome in the pleasant room and
sedately slept or rolled about while the mistress worked.</p>
<p>But Truedale, while much in the old home, still kept his
five-room flat. He bought a good, serviceable dog that preferred a
bachelor life to any other and throve upon long evening strolls and
erratic feeding. There were plants growing in the windows&mdash;and
these Conning looked after with conscientious care.</p>
<p>When the first suffering and sense of abasement passed, Truedale
discovered that life in his little apartment was not only possible,
but also his salvation. All the spiritual essence left in him
survived best in those rooms. As time went by and Nella-Rose as an
actuality receded, her memory remained unembittered. Truedale never
cast blame upon her, though sometimes he tried to view her from the
outsider&rsquo;s position. No; always she eluded the material
estimate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than half real,&rdquo; so White had portrayed
her, and as such she gradually became to Truedale.</p>
<p>He plunged into business, as many a man had before him, to fill
the gaps in his life; and he found, as others had, that the taste
of power&mdash;the discovery that he could meet and fulfil the
demands made upon him&mdash;carried him out of the depths and
eventually secured a place for him in the world of men that he
valued and strove to prove himself worthy of. He wisely went slowly
and took the advice of such men as McPherson and his uncle&rsquo;s
old lawyer. He grew in time to enjoy the position of trust as his
duties multiplied, and he often wondered how he could ever have
despised the common lot of his fellows. He deliberately, and from
choice, set his personal tastes aside&mdash;time enough for his
reading and writing when he had toughened his mental muscles, he
thought. Lynda deplored this, but Truedale explained:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Lyn, when I began to carve the thing
out&mdash;the play, you know&mdash;I had no idea how to handle the
tools; like many fools with a touch of talent, I thought I could
manage without preparation. I&rsquo;ve learned better. You cannot
get a thing over to people unless you know something of
life&mdash;speak the language. I&rsquo;m learning, and when I feel
that I cannot <i>help</i> writing&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Lynda saw his point; &ldquo;and now
let&rsquo;s haunt the theatres&mdash;see the machinery in running
order. We&rsquo;ll find out what people want and
<i>why</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went to the theatre and read plays. Brace made the
wholesome third and their lives settled into calm enjoyment that
was charming but which sometimes&mdash;not often, but
occasionally&mdash;made Lynda pause and consider. It would not
do&mdash;for Con&mdash;to fall into a pace that might defeat his
best good.</p>
<p>But this thought brought a deep crimson to the girl&rsquo;s
cheeks.</p>
<p>And then something happened. It was so subtle that Lynda
Kendall, least of all, realized the true significance.</p>
<p>Once in the early days of her secured self-support, William
Truedale had said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You give too much attention, girl, to your tailor and too
little to your dressmaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda had laughingly called her friend frivolous and defended
her wardrobe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One cannot doll up for business, Uncle
William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is business your whole life, Lynda? If so you had better
reform it. If women are going to pattern their lives after
men&rsquo;s they must go the whole way. A sensible man recognizes
the need of shutting the office door sometimes and putting on his
dress suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but Uncle William, what is the matter with this
perfectly built suit? I always slip a fresh blouse on when I am off
duty. I hate to be always changing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had a mother, Lynda, she would make you see what I
mean. An old fungus like me cannot be expected to command respect
from such an up-to-date humbug as you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had laughed it off and Lynda had, once or twice, donned a
house gown to please her critical friend, but eventually had
slipped back into suits and blouses.</p>
<p>All of a sudden one day&mdash;it was nearing holiday
time&mdash;she left her workroom at midday and, almost
shamefacedly, &ldquo;went shopping.&rdquo; As the fever got into
her blood she became reckless, and by five o&rsquo;clock had bought
and ordered home more delicate and exquisite finery than she had
ever owned in all her life before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s scandalous!&rdquo; she murmured to her gay,
young heart, &ldquo;an awful waste of good money, but for the first
time, I see how women can get clothes-mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She devoted the hour and a half before dinner to locating an
artistic dressmaker and putting herself in her hands.</p>
<p>The result was both startling and exciting. The first gown to
come home was a dull, golden-brown velvet thing so soft and
clinging and individual that it put its wearer into quite a
flutter. She &ldquo;did&rdquo; and undid her hair, and, in the
process, discovered that if she pulled the &ldquo;sides&rdquo;
loose there was a tendency to curl and the effect was distinctly
charming&mdash;with the strange gown, of course! Then, marshalling
all her courage, she trailed down to the library and thanked heaven
when she found the room empty. It would be easier to occupy the
stage than to make a late entrance when the audience was in
position. So Lynda sat down, tried to read, but was so nervous that
her eyes shone and her cheeks were rosy.</p>
<p>Brace and Conning came in together. &ldquo;Look who&rsquo;s
here!&rdquo; was Kendall&rsquo;s brotherly greeting. &ldquo;Gee!
Con, look at our lady friend!&rdquo; He held his sister off at
arms&rsquo; length and commented upon her &ldquo;points.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know your hair curled, Lyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, myself, until this afternoon. You
see,&rdquo; she trembled a bit, &ldquo;now that I do not have to go
in the subway to business there&rsquo;s no reason for
excluding&mdash;this sort of thing&rdquo; (she touched the pretty
gown), &ldquo;and once you let yourself go, you do not know where
you will land. Curls go with these frills; slippers,
too&mdash;look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she glanced up at Conning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m very&mdash;frivolous?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew&rdquo;&mdash;he was gazing seriously at
her&mdash;&ldquo;how handsome you are, Lyn. Wear that gown morning,
noon and night; it&rsquo;s stunning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you both like it. I feel a little unusual
in it&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll settle down. I have been a trifle prim
in dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like the giant&rsquo;s robe, Lynda Kendall&rsquo;s garments
seemed to transform her and endow her with the attributes peculiar
to themselves. So gradually, that it caused no wonder, she
developed the blessed gift of charm and it coloured life for
herself and others like a glow from a hidden fire.</p>
<p>All this did not interfere with her business. Once she donned
her working garb she was the capable Lynda of the past. A little
more sentiment, perhaps, appeared in her designs&mdash;a wider
conception; but that was natural, for happiness had come to
her&mdash;and a delicious sense of success. She, womanlike, began
to rejoice in her power. She heard of John Morrell&rsquo;s marriage
to a young western girl, about this time, with genuine delight. Her
sky was clearing of all regrets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morrell was in the office to-day,&rdquo; Brace told his
sister one evening, &ldquo;it seemed to me a bit brash for him to
lay it on so thick about his happiness and all that sort of
rot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it might be all right to another fellow, but it
sounded out of tune, somehow, to me. He says she is the kind that
has flung herself body and soul into love; I wager she&rsquo;s a
fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda looked serious at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully, &ldquo;and
she&rsquo;ll be happier with John, in the long run, if she has some
reservations. I did not think that once; I do now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;you, Lyn? You had reservations to
burn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had&mdash;too many. That was where the mistake
began.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;do not regret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda came close to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace, I regret nothing. I am learning that every step
leads to the next&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t stumble. If you
do&mdash;you have to pick yourself up and go back. If John learned
from me, I, too, have learned from him. I&rsquo;m going to try
to&mdash;love his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet she&rsquo;s a cross, somehow, between a cowboy and
an idiot. John protested too much about her charms. She&rsquo;s got
a sister&mdash;sounds a bit to me as if Morrell had married them
both. She&rsquo;s coming to live with them after awhile. When I
fall in love, it&rsquo;s going to be with an orphan out of an
asylum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda laughed and gave her brother a hug. Then she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our circle is widening and, by the way Brace, I&rsquo;m
going to begin to entertain a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord, Lyn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! modestly&mdash;until I can use my stiff little wings.
A dinner now and then and a luncheon occasionally when I know
enough nice women to make a decent showing. Clothes and women, when
adopted late in life, are difficult. But oh! Brace, it is
great&mdash;this blessed home life of mine! The coming away from my
beloved work to something even better.&rdquo;</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>The pulse of a city throbs faster in the winter. All the
vitality of well-nourished men and women is at its fullest, while
for them who fall below the normal, the necessity of the struggle
for existence keys them to a high pitch. Not so in the deep, far
mountain places. There, the inhabitants hide from the elements and
withdraw into themselves. For weeks at a time no human being
ventures forth from the shelter and comparative comfort of the dull
cabins. Families, pressed thus close and debarred from the freedom
of the open, suffer mentally and spiritually as one from the wider
haunts of men can hardly conceive.</p>
<p>When Nella-Rose turned away from Truedale that golden autumn
day, she faced winter and the shut-in terrors of the cold and
loneliness. In two weeks the last vestige of autumn would be past,
and the girl could not contemplate being imprisoned with Marg and
her father while waiting for love to return to her. She paused on
the wet, leafy path and considered. She had told Truedale that she
would go home, but what did it matter. She would go to Miss Lois
Ann&rsquo;s. She would know when Truedale returned; she could go to
him. In the meantime no human being would annoy her or question her
in that cabin far back in the Hollow. And Lois Ann would while away
the long hours by story and song. It seemed to her there was but
one thing to do&mdash;and Nella-Rose did it! She fled to the woman
whose name Truedale had barely heard.</p>
<p>It took her three good hours to make the distance to the Hollow
and it was quite dark when she tapped on the door of the little
cabin. To all appearances the place was deserted; but after the
second knock a shutter to the right of the door was pushed open and
a long, lean hand appeared holding a lighted candle, while a deep,
rich voice called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jes&rsquo; Nella-Rose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hand withdrew, the shutter was closed, and in another minute
the door was flung wide and the girl drawn into the warm,
comfortable room. Supper, of a better sort than most hill-women
knew, was spread out on a clean table, and in the cheer and safety
Nella-Rose expanded and decided to take the old woman into her
confidence at once and so secure present comfort until Truedale
came back to claim her.</p>
<p>This Lois Ann, in whose sunken eyes eternal youth burned and
glowed, was a mystery in the hills and was never questioned. Long
ago she had come, asked no favours, and settled down to fare as
best she could. There was but one sure passport to her sanctuary.
That was&mdash;trouble! Once misfortune overtook one, sex was
forgotten, but at other times it was understood that Miss Lois Ann
had small liking or sympathy for men, while on the other hand she
brooded over women and children with the everlasting strength of
maternity.</p>
<p>It was suspected, and with good reason, that many refugees from
justice passed through Miss Lois Ann&rsquo;s front door and escaped
by other exits. Officers of the law had, more than once, traced
their quarry to the dreary cabin and demanded entrance for search.
This was always promptly given, but never had a culprit been found
on the premises! White understood and admired the old woman; he
always halted justice, if possible, outside her domain, but, being
a hill-man, Jim had his suspicions which he never voiced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now, honey, what yo&rsquo; coming to me fo&rsquo; this
black night?&rdquo; said Lois Ann to Nella-Rose after the evening
meal was cleared away, the fire replenished, and &ldquo;with four
feet on the fender&rdquo; the two were content.
&ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo; The wonderful eyes searched the happy, young
face and at the glance, Nella-Rose knew that she was compelled to
confide! There was no choice. She felt the power closing in about
her, she found it not so easy as she had supposed, to explain. She
sparred for time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me a right, nice story, Miss Lois Ann,&rdquo; she
pleaded, &ldquo;and of course it&rsquo;s no trouble that has
brought me here! Trouble! Huh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; And now Nella-Rose sank to the
hearthstone and bent her head on the lap of the old woman. It was
more possible to speak when she could escape those seeking eyes.
She closed her own and tried to call Truedale to the dark space and
to her support&mdash;but he would not come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is trouble, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! it&rsquo;s&mdash;oh! it&rsquo;s the&mdash;joy,
Miss Lois Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! And you&rsquo;ve found out that the young scamp
is back&mdash;that Lawson?&rdquo; Lois Ann, for a moment, knew
relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t Burke,&rdquo; the words came
lingeringly. &ldquo;Yes, I know he&rsquo;s back&mdash;is he
here?&rdquo; This affrightedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;but he&rsquo;s been. He may come again. His
maw&rsquo;s always empty, but I will say this for the
scoundrel&mdash;he gives more than he takes, in the long run. But
if it isn&rsquo;t Lawson, who then? Not that snake-in-the-grass,
Jed?&rdquo; Love and trouble were synonymous with Lois Ann when one
was young and pretty and a fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jed? Jed indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child, out with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I am going to tell you, Miss Lois Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the knotted old hand fell like a withered leaf upon the
soft hair&mdash;the woman-heart was ready to bear another burden.
Not a word did the closed lips utter while the amazing tale ran on
and on in the gentle drawl. Consternation, even doubt of the
girl&rsquo;s sanity, held part in the old woman&rsquo;s keen mind,
but gradually the truth of the confession established itself, and
once the fact was realized that a stranger&mdash;and <i>such</i> a
one&mdash;had been hidden in the hills while this thing, that the
girl was telling, was going on&mdash;the strong, clear mind of the
listener interpreted the truth by the knowledge gained through a
long, hard life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so, you see, Miss Lois Ann, it&rsquo;s like he opened
heaven for me; and I want to hide here till he comes to take me up,
up into heaven with him. And no one else must know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lois Ann had torn the cawl from Nella-Rose&rsquo;s baby
face&mdash;had felt, in her superstitious heart, that the child was
mysteriously destined to see wide and far; and now, with agony that
she struggled to conceal, she knew that to her was given the task
of drawing the veil from the soul of the girl at her feet in order
that she might indeed see far and wide into the kingdom of
suffering women.</p>
<p>For a moment the woman fenced, she would put the cup from her if
she could, like all humans who understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;are yo&rsquo; lying to me?&rdquo; she asked
faintly, and oh, but she would have given much to hear the
girl&rsquo;s impish laugh of assent. Instead, she saw
Nella-Rose&rsquo;s eyes grow deadly serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no lie, Miss Lois Ann; it&rsquo;s a right
beautiful truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for days and nights you stayed alone with this
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lean hand, with unrelenting strength, now gripped the
drooping face and held it firmly while the firelight played full
upon it, meanwhile the keen old eyes bored into Nella-Rose&rsquo;s
very soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&mdash;he is my man! You forget the&mdash;marrying
on the hill, Miss Lois Ann!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice was raised a bit and the colour left the trembling
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your man!&rdquo; And a bitter laugh rang out wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Miss Lois Ann! Yo&rsquo; shall not look at me like
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vision was dulled&mdash;Nella-Rose shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not look at me like that; God would
not&mdash;why should you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God!&rdquo;&mdash;the cracked voice spoke the word
bitterly. &ldquo;God! What does God care for women? It&rsquo;s the
men as God made things for, and us-all has to fend them
off&mdash;men and God are agin us women!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! Let me free. I was so happy until&mdash;Oh! Miss
Lois Ann, you shall not take my happiness away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; came to the right place, yo&rsquo; po&rsquo;
lil&rsquo; chile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes had seen all they needed to see and the hand let drop
the pretty, quivering face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait&mdash;oh! certainly we-all will wait a
week; two weeks; then three. An&rsquo; we-all will hide close and
see what we-all shall see!&rdquo; A hard, pitiful laugh echoed
through the room. &ldquo;And now to bed! Take the closet back
o&rsquo; my chamber. No one can reach yo&rsquo; there, chile. Sleep
and dream and&mdash;forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that night Burke Lawson, after an hour&rsquo;s struggle,
determined to come forth among his kind and take his place.
Nella-Rose had decided him. He was tired of hiding, tired of
playing his game. One look at the face he had loved from its
babyhood had turned the tide. Lawson had never before been so long
shut away from his guiding star. And she had said that he might ask
again when he dared&mdash;and so he came forth from his cave-place.
Once outside, he drew a deep, free breath, turned his handsome face
to the sky, and <i>felt</i> the prayer that another might have
voiced.</p>
<p>He thought of Nella-Rose, remembered her love of adventure, her
splendid courage and spirit. Nothing so surely could win her as the
proposal he was about to make. To ask her to remain at Pine Cone
and settle down with him as her hill-billy would hold small
temptation, but to take her away to new and wider fields&mdash;that
was another matter! And go they would&mdash;he and she. He would
get a horse somewhere, somehow. With Nella-Rose behind him, he
would never stop until a parson was reached, and after
that&mdash;why the world would be theirs from which to choose.</p>
<p>And it was at that point of Lawson&rsquo;s fervid, religious
state that Jed Martin had materialized and made it imperative that
he be dealt with summarily and definitely.</p>
<p>After confiding his immediate future to the subjugated
Martin&mdash;having forced him to cover at the point of a
pistol&mdash;Burke, with his big, wholesome laugh, crawled again
out of the cave. Then, raising himself to his full height, he
strode over the sodden trail toward White&rsquo;s cabin with the
lightest, purest heart he had carried for many a day. But Fate had
an ugly trick in store for him. He was half way to White&rsquo;s
when he heard steps. Habit was strong. He promptly climbed a tree.
The moon came out just then and disclosed the follower.
&ldquo;Blake&rsquo;s dawg,&rdquo; muttered Lawson and, as the big
hound took his stand under the tree, he understood matters. Blake
was his worst enemy; he had a score to settle about the revenue men
and a term in jail for which Lawson was responsible. While the
general hunt was on, Blake had entered in, thinking to square
things, while not bringing himself into too much prominence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; infernal critter!&rdquo; murmured Lawson,
&ldquo;in another minute you&rsquo;ll howl, yo&rsquo; po&rsquo;
brute. I hate ter shoot yo&rsquo;&mdash;yo&rsquo; being what
yo&rsquo; are&mdash;but here goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that White&rsquo;s was impossible for a time and
Nella-Rose must wait. In a day or so, probably&mdash;so Burke
quickly considered&mdash;he could make a dash back, get White to
help him, and bear off his prize, but for the moment the sooner he
reached safety beyond the ridge, the better. Shooting a dog was no
light matter.</p>
<p>Lawson reached safety but with a broken leg; for, going
down-stream, he had met with misfortune and, during that long, hard
winter, unable to fend for himself, he was safely hidden by a
timely friend and served by a doctor who was smuggled to the scene
and well paid for his help and silence.</p>
<p>And in Lois Ann&rsquo;s cabin Nella-Rose waited, at first with
serene hope, and then, with pitiful longing. She and the old woman
never referred to the conversation of the first night but the girl
was sure she was being watched and shielded and she felt the doubt
and scorn in the attitude of Lois Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll send for my man,&rdquo; at
last she desperately decided at the end of the second week. But she
dared not risk a journey to the far station in order to send a
telegram. So she watched for a chance to send a letter that she had
carefully and painfully written.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to Miss Lois Ann&rsquo;s in Devil-may-come
Hollow. I&rsquo;m trusting and loving you, but Miss Lois
Ann&mdash;don&rsquo;t believe! So please, Mister Man come and tell
her and then go back and I will wait&mdash;most truly</p>
<p>Your Nella-Rose.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>then she crossed the name out and scribbled &ldquo;Your
doney-gal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was early in the third week that Bill Trim came whistling
down the trail, on a cold, bitterly cold, November morning. He bore
a load of &ldquo;grateful gifts&rdquo; to Lois Ann from men and
women whom she had succoured in times of need and who always
remembered her, practically, when winter &ldquo;set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill was a half-wit but as strong as an ox; and, once set upon a
task, managed it in a way that had given him a secure position in
the community. He carried mail into the remotest
districts&mdash;when there was any to carry. He &ldquo;toted&rdquo;
heavy loads and gathered gossip and spilled it liberally. He was
impersonal, ignorant, and illiterate, but he did his poor best and
grovelled at the feet of any one who showed him the least
affection. He was horribly afraid of Lois Ann for no reason that he
could have given; he was afraid of her eyes&mdash;her thin,
claw-like hands. As he now delivered the bundles he had for her he
accepted the food she gave and then darted away to eat it in
comfort beyond the reach of those glances he dreaded.</p>
<p>And there Nella-Rose sought him and sat beside him with a choice
morsel she had saved from her finer fare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trim,&rdquo; she whispered when he was about to start,
&ldquo;here is a letter&mdash;Miss Lois Ann wants you to
mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bright eyes looked yearningly into the dull, hopeless
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;hate the ole &rsquo;un!&rdquo; confided Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yo&rsquo; don&rsquo;t hate me, Bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, do it for me, but don&rsquo;t tell a living
soul that you saw me. See, Bill, I have a whole dollar&mdash;I
earned it by berry-picking. Pay for the letter and then keep the
rest. And if you ever see Marg, and she asks about me&mdash;and
whether you&rsquo;ve seen me&mdash;tell her&rdquo; (and here
Nella-Rose&rsquo;s white teeth gleamed in the mischievous smile),
&ldquo;tell her you saw me walking in the Hollow with Burke
Lawson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dull fellow shook with foolish laughter. &ldquo;I sho&rsquo;
will!&rdquo; he said, and then tucked the letter and dollar bill in
the breast of his shirt. &ldquo;And now, lil&rsquo; doney-gal, let
me touch yo&rsquo; hand,&rdquo; he pleaded,
&ldquo;this&mdash;er&mdash;way.&rdquo; And like a poor frayed,
battered knight he pressed his lips to the small, brown hand of the
one person who had always been kind to him.</p>
<p>At sunset Bill halted to eat his supper and warm his stiffened
body. He tried to build a fire but the wood was wet and in
desperation he took, at last, the papers from inside his thin coat,
they had helped to shield him from the cold, and utilized them to
start the pine cones. He rested and feasted and later went his way.
At the post office he searched among his rags for the letter and
the money. Then his face went white as ashes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gawd a&rsquo;mighty!&rdquo; he whimpered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Merrivale came from behind the
counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I done burn my chest protector. I&rsquo;ll freeze without
the papers.&rdquo; Then Bill explained the fire building but,
recalling Lois Ann, withheld any further information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you fool,&rdquo; Merrivale said not unkindly,
&ldquo;take all the papers you want. And take this old coat, too.
And look, lad, in yo&rsquo; wandering have yo&rsquo; seen
Greyson&rsquo;s lil&rsquo; gal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill looked cunning and drawing close whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her&mdash;and him, I seed &rsquo;im, back in the sticks!
Her&mdash;and him!&rdquo; Then he laughed his foolish laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought as much!&rdquo; Merrivale nodded, with the
trouble a good man knows at times in his eyes; but his faith in
Burke coming to his aid. &ldquo;You mean&mdash;Lawson?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Bill nodded foolishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then keep yo&rsquo; mouth shut!&rdquo; warned Merrivale.
&ldquo;If I hear yo&rsquo; gabbing&mdash;I&rsquo;ll flax the hide
o&rsquo; yo&rsquo;, sure as I keep store.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>A month, then two, passed in the desolate cabin in the Hollow.
Winter clutched and held Pine Cone Settlement in a deadly grip. Old
people died and little children were born. Lois Ann, when it was
physically possible, got to the homes of suffering and eased the
women, while she berated the men for bringing poor souls to such
dread passes. But always Nella-Rose hid and shrank from sight. No
need, now, to warn her. A new and terrible look had come into her
eyes, and when Lois Ann saw that creeping terror she knew that her
hour had come. To save Nella-Rose, she believed, she must lay low
every illusion and, with keen and deliberate force, she pressed the
apple of the knowledge of life between the girlish lips. The bitter
truth at last ate its way into the girl&rsquo;s soul and gradually
hate, such as she had never conceived, grew and consumed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will not die,&rdquo; thought the old woman watching
her day by day.</p>
<p>And Nella-Rose did not die, at least not outwardly, but in her,
as in Truedale, the fine, first glow of pure faith and passion,
untouched by the world&rsquo;s interpretation, faded and shrivelled
forever.</p>
<p>The long winter hid the secret in the dreary cabin. The roads
and trails were closed; none drew near for shelter or succour.</p>
<p>By springtime Nella-Rose was afraid of every living creature
except the faithful soul who stood guard over her. She ran and
trembled at the least sound; she was white and hollow-eyed, but her
hate was stronger and fiercer than ever.</p>
<p>Early summer came&mdash;the gladdest time of the year. The heat
was broken by soft showers; the flowers bloomed riotously, and in
July the world-old miracle occurred in Lois Ann&rsquo;s
cabin&mdash;Nella-Rose&rsquo;s child was born! With its coming the
past seemed blotted out; hate gave place to reverent awe and
tenderness. In the young mother the woman rose supreme and she
would not permit her mind to hold a harmful thought.</p>
<p>Through the hours of her travail, when Lois Ann, desperate and
frightened, had implored, threatened, and commanded that she should
tell the name of the father of her child, she only moaned and
closed her lips the firmer. But when she looked upon her baby she
smiled radiantly and whispered to the patient old creature beside
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Lois Ann, this lil&rsquo; child has no father. It is
my baby and God sent it. I shall call her Ann&mdash;cuz
you&rsquo;ve been right good to me&mdash;you sholy have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was &ldquo;lil&rsquo; Ann&rdquo; and, since the strange
reticence and misunderstood joyousness remained, Lois Ann, at her
wit&rsquo;s end, believing that death or insanity threatened, went
secretly to the Greyson house to confess and get assistance.</p>
<p>Peter was away with Jed. The two hung together now like burrs.
Whatever of relaxation Martin could hope for lay in Greyson;
whatever of material comfort Peter could command, must come through
Jed, and so they laboured, in slow, primitive fashion, and edged in
a little pleasure together. Marg, having achieved her ambition, was
content and, for the first time in her life, easy to get along
with. And into this comparative Eden Lois Ann came with words that
shattered the peace and calm.</p>
<p>In Marg&rsquo;s private thought she had never doubted that her
sister had often been with Burke Lawson in the Hollow. When he
disappeared, she believed Nella-Rose was with him, but she had
supported and embellished her father&rsquo;s story concerning them
because it secured her own self-respect and covered the tracks of
the degenerate pair with a shield that they in no wise deserved,
but which put their defenders in a truly Christian attitude.</p>
<p>Marg was alone in the cabin when Lois Ann entered. She looked up
flushed and eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How-de,&rdquo; she said genially. &ldquo;Set and have a
bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no time,&rdquo; the old woman returned
pantingly. &ldquo;Nella-Rose is down to my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warm, sunny room grew stifling to Marg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a-doing?&rdquo; she said, half under her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a&mdash;lil&rsquo; baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colour faded from Marg&rsquo;s face, leaving it pasty and
heavy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burke&mdash;thar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t been thar all winter. I hid Nella-Rose and
her shame but I dare not any longer. I reckon she&rsquo;s going
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be; or&mdash;&rdquo; and here Lois Ann tapped her
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&mdash;he went and left her?&rdquo; groaned
Marg&mdash;&ldquo;the devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lois Ann watched the terrible anger rising in the younger woman
and of a sudden she realized how useless it would be to voice the
wild tale Nella-Rose held to. So she only nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you,&rdquo; Marg decided at once,
&ldquo;and don&rsquo;t you let on to father or
Jed&mdash;they&rsquo;d do some killing this time, sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together the two made their way to the Hollow and found
Nella-Rose in the quiet room with her baby nestling against her
tender breast. The look on her face might well stay the reproaches
on Marg&rsquo;s lips&mdash;she almost reeled back as the deep, true
eyes met hers. All the smothered sisterliness came to the surface
for an instant as she trembled and drew near to the two in the old
chintz-covered rocker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See! my baby, Marg. She is lil&rsquo; Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ann&mdash;what?&rdquo; whispered Marg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just lil&rsquo; Ann for&mdash;Miss Lois Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nella-Rose&rdquo; (and now Marg fell on her knees beside
her sister), &ldquo;tell me where he is. Tell me and as sure as God
lives I&rsquo;ll bring him back! I&rsquo;ll make him own you
and&mdash;and the baby or
he&rsquo;ll&mdash;he&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Nella-Rose laughed the laugh that drove Lois Ann to
distraction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send Marg away, Miss Lois Ann,&rdquo; Nella-Rose turned
to her only friend, &ldquo;she makes me so&mdash;so tired
and&mdash;I do not want any one but you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marg got upon her feet, all the tenderness and compassion
gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are&mdash;&rdquo; she began, but Lois Ann was between
her and Nella-Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she commanded with terrible scorn. &ldquo;Go!
You are not fit to touch them. Go! Dying or mad&mdash;the girl
belongs to me and not to such as has viper blood in their veins.
Go!&rdquo; And Marg went with the sound of Nella-Rose&rsquo;s
crooning to her child ringing in her ears.</p>
<p>Things happened dramatically after that in the deep woods. Marg
kept the secret of the Hollow cabin in her seething heart. She was
frightened, fearing her father or Jed might discover Nella-Rose.
But she was, at times, filled with a strange longing to see her
sister and touch that wonderful thing that lay on the guilty
mother-breast.</p>
<p>Was Nella-Rose forever to have the glory even in her shame,
while she, Marg, with all the rights of womanhood, could hold no
hope of maternity?</p>
<p>For one reason or another Marg often stole to the woods as near
the Hollow as she dared to go. She hoped for news but none came;
and it was late August when, one sunny noon, she confronted Burke
Lawson!</p>
<p>Lawson&rsquo;s face was strange and awful to look on. Marg drew
away from him in fear. She could not know but Burke had had a
terrific experience that day and he was on the path for revenge and
any one in his way must suffer. Freed at last from his captivity,
he had travelled across the range and straight to Jim White. And
the sheriff, ready for the recreant, greeted him without mercy,
judging him guilty until he proved himself otherwise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you done with Nella-Rose?&rdquo; he asked, standing
before Burke with slow fire in his deep eyes.</p>
<p>Lawson could never have been the man he was if he were not
capable of holding his own council and warding off attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think I&rsquo;ve done anything with
her?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None o&rsquo; that, Burke Lawson,&rdquo; Jim warned.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been yo&rsquo; friend, but I swear I&rsquo;ll
toss yo&rsquo; ter the dogs, as is after you, with as little
feelin&rsquo; as I would if yo&rsquo; were a chunk o&rsquo; dead
meat&mdash;if you&rsquo;ve harmed that lil&rsquo; gal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I ain&rsquo;t harmed her, Jim. And now let&rsquo;s
set down and talk it over. I want to&mdash;to bring her home; I
want ter live a decent life &rsquo;mong yo&rsquo;-all. Jim,
don&rsquo;t shoot &rsquo;til yo&rsquo; make sure yo&rsquo; ought
ter shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus brought to reason Jim sat down, shared his meal with his
reinstated friend, and gave him the gossip of the hills. Lawson ate
because he was well-nigh starved and he knew he had some rough work
ahead; he listened because he needed all the guiding possible and
he shielded the name and reputation of Nella-Rose with the splendid
courage that filled his young heart and mind. And then he set forth
upon his quest with these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Gawd A&rsquo;mighty hears me, Jim White, I&rsquo;ll
fetch that lil&rsquo; Nella-Rose home and live like a man from now
on. Wipe off my sins, Jim; make a place for me, old man, and
I&rsquo;ll never shame it&mdash;or God blast me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>White took the strong young hand and felt his eyes grow
misty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; place is here, Burke,&rdquo; he said, and then
Lawson was on his way.</p>
<p>A half hour later he encountered Marg. In his own mind Burke had
a pretty clear idea of what had occurred. Not having heard any
suggestion of Truedale, he was as ignorant of him as though
Truedale had never existed. Jed, then, was the only man to hold
guilty. Jed had, in passion and revenge, wronged Nella-Rose and had
after, like the sneak and coward he was, sought to secure his own
safety by marrying Marg. But what had they done with Nella-Rose?
She had, according to White, disappeared the night that Jed had
been tied in the cave. Well, Jed must confess and pay!&mdash;pay to
the uttermost. But between him and Jed Marg now stood!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; cried Marg. &ldquo;You! What yo&rsquo; mean
coming brazen to us-all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of my way!&rdquo; commanded Burke,
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out soon enough. Let me by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Marg held her ground and Lawson waited. The look in his eyes
awed Marg, but his presence enraged her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you-all done with Nella-Rose?&rdquo; Lawson
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better find out! You&rsquo;ve left it long
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whar is she, I say? And I tell you now, Marg&mdash;every
one as has wronged that lil&rsquo; girl will answer to me. Whar is
she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;she and her young-un are up to Lois
Ann&rsquo;s. They&rsquo;ve been hid all winter. No one but me
knows; you&rsquo;ve time to make good&mdash;before&mdash;before
father and Jed get yo&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lawson took this like a blow between the eyes. He could not
speak&mdash;for a moment he could not think; then a lurid fire of
conviction burned into his very soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&mdash;that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; he muttered, coming so
close to Marg that she shrank back afraid. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s
it! Yo&rsquo;-all have damned and all but killed the po&rsquo;
lil&rsquo; girl&mdash;then flung her to&mdash;to the devil!
You&rsquo;ve taken the leavings&mdash;you! &rsquo;cause yo&rsquo;
couldn&rsquo;t get anything else. Yo&rsquo; and Jed&rdquo; (here
Lawson laughed a fearless, terrifying laugh), &ldquo;yo&rsquo; and
Jed is honourably married, you two, and she&mdash;lil&rsquo;
Nella-Rose&mdash;left to&mdash;&rdquo; Emotion choked Lawson; then
he plunged on: &ldquo;He&mdash;he wronged her&mdash;the brute, and
you took him to&mdash;to save him and yourself you&mdash;! And
she?&mdash;why, she&rsquo;s the only holy thing in the hills; you
couldn&rsquo;t damn her&mdash;you two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the love o&rsquo; Gawd!&rdquo; begged Marg,
&ldquo;keep yo&rsquo; tongue still and off us! We ain&rsquo;t done
her any wrong; every one, even Jed, thinks she is with you. Miss
Lois Ann hid her&mdash;I only knew a week ago. I ain&rsquo;t told a
soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of contempt grew upon Burke&rsquo;s face and hardened
there. He was thinking quick and desperately. In a vague way he
realized that he had the reins in his hands; his only concern was
to know whither he should drive. But, above and beyond
all&mdash;deep true, and spiritual&mdash;were his love and pity for
Nella-Rose.</p>
<p>They had all betrayed and deserted her. Not for an instant did
Lawson doubt that. Their cowardice and duplicity neither surprised
nor daunted him; but his pride&mdash;his sense of
superiority&mdash;bade him pause and reflect before he plunged
ahead. Finally he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you-all depend upon her safety for your safety! Take
it&mdash;and be damned! She&rsquo;s been with me&mdash;yo&rsquo;
followin&rsquo; me? She&rsquo;s been with me, rightful married and
happy&mdash;happy! From now on I&rsquo;ll manage lil&rsquo;
Nella-Rose&rsquo;s doings, and the first whisper from man or woman
agin her will be agin me&mdash;and God knows I won&rsquo;t be
blamed for what I do then! Tell that skunk of yours,&rdquo; Lawson
glared at the terrified Marg, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m strong enough to
outbid him with the devil, but from now on him and you&mdash;mind
this well, Marg Greyson&mdash;him and you are to be our loving
brother and sister. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a wild laugh Burke took to the woods.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>Two years and a half following William Truedale&rsquo;s death
found things much as the old gentleman would have liked. Often
Lynda Kendall, sitting beside the long, low, empty chair, longed to
tell her old friend all about it. Strange to say, the recluse in
life had become very vital in death. He had wrought, in his silent,
lonely detachment, better even than he knew. His charities, shorn
of the degrading elements of many similar ones, were carried on
without a hitch. Dr. McPherson, under his crust of hardness, was an
idealist and almost a sentimentalist; but above all he was a man to
inspire respect and command obedience. No hospital with which he
had to deal was unmarked by his personality. Neglect and
indifference were fatal attributes for internes and nurses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give the youngsters sleep enough, food and relaxation
enough,&rdquo; he would say to the superintendents, &ldquo;but
after that expect&mdash;and get&mdash;faithful, conscientious
service with as much humanity as possible thrown in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sanatorium for cases such as William Truedale&rsquo;s was
already attracting wide attention. The finest men to be obtained
were on the staff; specially trained nurses were selected; and
Lynda had put her best thought and energy into the furnishing of
the small rooms and spacious wards.</p>
<p>Conning, becoming used to the demands made upon him, was at last
dependable, and grew to see, in each sufferer the representative of
the uncle he had never understood; whom he had neglected and, too
late, had learned to respect. He was almost ashamed to confess how
deeply interested he was in the sanatorium. Recalling at times the
loneliness and weariness of William Truedale&rsquo;s
days&mdash;picturing the sad night when he had, as Lynda put it,
opened the door himself, to release and hope&mdash;Conning sought
to ease the way for others and so fill the waiting hours that less
opportunity was left for melancholy thought. He introduced
amusements and pastimes in the hospital, often shared them himself,
and still attended to the other business that William
Truedale&rsquo;s affairs involved.</p>
<p>The men who had been appointed to direct and control these
interests eventually let the reins fall into the hands eager to
grasp them and, in the endless labour and sense of usefulness,
Conning learned to know content and comparative peace. He grew to
look upon his present life as a kind of belated reparation. He was
not depressed; with surprising adaptability he accepted what was
inevitable and, while reserving, in the personal sense, his past
for private hours, he managed to construct a philosophy and
cheerfulness that carried him well on the tide of events.</p>
<p>It was something of a shock to him one evening, nearly three
years after his visit to Pine Cone, to find himself looking at
Lynda Kendall as if he had never seen her before.</p>
<p>She was going out with Brace and was in evening dress. Truedale
had never seen her gowned so, and he realized that she was
extremely handsome and&mdash;something more. She came close to him,
drawing on her long, loose, white gloves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot bear to go and leave you&mdash;all alone!&rdquo;
she said, raising her eyes to his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, John Morrell is showing us his brand-new wife
to-night&mdash;and I couldn&rsquo;t resist; but I&rsquo;ll try to
break away early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are eager to see&mdash;Mrs. Morrell?&rdquo; Truedale
asked, and suddenly recalled the relation Lynda had once held to
Morrell. He had not thought of it for many a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very. You see I hope to be great friends with her. I
want&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Lynda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to help her understand&mdash;John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me button your glove, Lyn&rdquo;&mdash;for Truedale
saw her hands were trembling though her eyes were peaceful and
happy. And then as the long, slim hand rested in his, he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;have never regretted, Lyn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regretted? Does a woman regret when she&rsquo;s saved
from a mistake and gets off scot-free as well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at each other for a moment and then Lynda drew away
her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Con, and please miss us a little, but not too
much. What will you do to pass the time until we return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think&rdquo;&mdash;Truedale pulled himself up
sharply&mdash;&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go up under the eaves and
get out&mdash;the old play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! how splendid! And you will&mdash;let me hear
it&mdash;some day, soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Business is going easier now. I can think of it
without neglecting better things. Good-night, Lyn. Tuck your coat
up close, the night&rsquo;s bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, alone in the warm, bright room, Truedale had a
distinct sense of Lynda having taken something besides herself
away. She had left the room hideously lonely; it became unbearable
to remain there and, like a boy, Conning ran up to the small room
next the roof.</p>
<p>He took the old play out&mdash;he had not unpacked it since he
came from Pine Cone! He laid it before him and presently became
absorbed in reading it from the beginning. It was after eleven when
he raised his tired eyes from the pages and leaned back in his
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m like&mdash;all men!&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;All men&mdash;and I thought things had gone deeper with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What he was recognizing was that the play and the subtle
influence that Nella-Rose had had upon him had both lost their
terrific hold. He could contemplate the past without the sickening
sense of wrong and shock that had once overpowered him. Realizing
the full meaning of all that had gone into his past experience, he
found himself thinking of Lynda as she had looked a few hours
before. He resented the lesser hold the past still had upon
him&mdash;he wanted to shake it free. Not bitterly&mdash;not with
contempt&mdash;but, he argued, why should his life be shadowed
always by a mistake, cruel and unpardonable as it was, when she,
that little ignorant partner in the wrong, had gone her way and had
doubtless by now put him forever from her mind?</p>
<p>How small a part it had played with her, poor child. She had
been betrayed by her strange imagination and suddenly awakened
passion; she had followed blindly where he had led, but when
catastrophe had threatened one who had been part of her former
life&mdash;familiar with all that was real to her&mdash;how readily
the untamed instinct had reverted to its own!</p>
<p>And he&mdash;Truedale comforted himself&mdash;he had come back
to <i>his</i> own, and his own had made its claim upon him. Why
should he not have his second chance? He wanted love&mdash;not
friendship; he wanted&mdash;Lynda! All else faded and Lynda, the
new Lynda&mdash;Lynda with the hair that had learned to curl, the
girl with the pretty white shoulders and sweet, kind
eyes&mdash;stood pleadingly close in the shabby old room and
demanded recognition. &ldquo;She thinks,&rdquo; and here Truedale
covered his eyes, &ldquo;that I am&mdash;as I was when I began my
life&mdash;here! What would she say&mdash;if she knew? She, God
bless her, is not like others. Faithful, pure, she could not
forgive the <i>truth</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale, thinking so of Lynda Kendall, owned to his best self
that because the woman who now filled his life held to her high
ideals&mdash;would never lower them&mdash;he could honour and
reverence her. If she, like him, could change, and accept selfishly
that which she would scorn in another, she would not be the
splendid creature she was. And yet&mdash;without conceit or
vanity&mdash;Truedale believed that Lynda felt for him what he felt
for her.</p>
<p>Never doubting that he could bring to her an unsullied past, she
was, delicately, in finest woman-fashion, laying her heart open to
him. She knew that he had little to offer and yet&mdash;and
yet&mdash;she was&mdash;willing! Truedale knew this to be true. And
then he decided he must, even at this late day, tell Lynda of the
past. For her sake he dare not venture any further concealment.
Once she understood&mdash;once she recovered from her surprise and
shock&mdash;she would be his friend, he felt confident of that; but
she would be spared any deeper personal interest. It was
Lynda&rsquo;s magnificent steadfastness that now appealed to
Truedale. With the passing of his own season of madness, he looked
upon this calm serenity of her character with deepest
admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best any man should hope for,&rdquo; he
admitted&mdash;turning, as he thought, his back upon his
yearning&mdash;&ldquo;any man who has played the fool as I have, is
the sympathetic friendship of a good woman. What right has a man to
fall from what he knows a woman holds highest, and then look to her
to change her ideals to fit his pattern?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arriving at this conclusion, Truedale wrapped the tattered
shreds of his self-respect about him and accepted, as best he
could, the prospect of Lynda&rsquo;s adjustment to the future.</p>
<p>Brace and Lynda did not return in time to see Truedale that
night. At twelve, with a resigned sigh, he put away his play and
went to his lonely rooms in the tall apartment farther uptown. His
dog was waiting for him with the reproachful look in his faithful
eyes that reminded Truedale that the poor beast had not had an
outing for twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, old fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;better late
than never,&rdquo; and the two descended to the street. They walked
sedately for an hour. The dog longed to gambol; he was young enough
to associate outdoors with license; but being a friend as well as a
dog, he felt that this was rather a time for close comradeship, so
he pattered along at his master&rsquo;s heels and once in a while
pushed his cold nose into the limp hand swinging by
Truedale&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; Conning thought,
reaching down to pat the sleek head, &ldquo;I can keep you
without&mdash;confession!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For three days and nights Truedale stayed away from the old
home. Business was his excuse&mdash;he offered it in the form of a
note and a bunch of violets. Lynda telephoned on the second day and
asked him if he were quite well. The tone of her voice made him
decide to see her at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come to dinner to-night, Lyn?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Con, but I must dine with some people who have
bought a hideous house and want me to get them out of the scrape by
remodelling the inside. They&rsquo;re awfully rich and
impossible&mdash;it&rsquo;s a sort of duty to the public, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow then, Lyn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. Only Brace will be dining with the Morrells;
by the way, she&rsquo;s a dear, Con.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next night was terrifically stormy&mdash;one of those spring
storms that sweep everything before them. The bubbles danced on the
pavements, the gutters ran floods, and fragments of umbrellas and
garments floated incongruously on the tide.</p>
<p>Battling against the wind, Conning made his way to
Lynda&rsquo;s. As he drew near the house the glow from the windows
seemed to meet and touch him with welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll economize somewhere,&rdquo; Lynda often said,
&ldquo;but when darkness comes I&rsquo;m always going to do my best
to get the better of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just for one blank moment Truedale had a sickening thought:
&ldquo;Suppose that welcome was never again for him, after this
night?&rdquo; Then he laughed derisively. Lynda might have her
ideals, her eternal reservations, but she also had her superb
faithfulness. After she knew <i>all</i>, she would still be his
friend.</p>
<p>When he went into the library Lynda sat before the fire knitting
a long strip of vivid wools. Conning had never seen her so employed
and it had the effect of puzzling him; it was like seeing
her&mdash;well, smoking, as some of her friends did! Nothing wrong
in it&mdash;but, inharmonious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you making, Lyn?&rdquo; he asked, taking the
ottoman and drawing close to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t anything, Con. No one wants trash
like this. It fulfils its mission when it is ravelled and knitted,
then unravelled. You know what Stevenson says: &lsquo;I travel for
travel&rsquo;s sake; the great affair is to move.&rsquo; I knit for
knitting&rsquo;s sake; it keeps my hands busy while my&mdash;my
soul basks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up with a smile and Truedale saw that she was ill at
ease. It was the one thing that unnerved him. Had she been her old,
self-contained self he could have depended upon her to bear her
part while he eased his soul by burdening hers; but now he caught
in her the appealing tenderness that had always awakened in old
William Truedale the effort to save her from herself&mdash;from the
cares others laid upon her.</p>
<p>Conning, instead of plunging into his confession, looked at her
in such a protecting, yearning way that Lynda&rsquo;s eyes fell,
and the soft colour slowly crept in her cheeks.</p>
<p>In the stillness, that neither knew how to break, Truedale
noticed the gown Lynda wore. It was blue and clinging. The
whiteness of her slim arms showed through the loose sleeves; the
round throat was bare and girlish in its drooping curve.</p>
<p>For one mad moment Truedale tried to stifle his conscience. Why
should he not have this love and happiness that lay close to him?
In what was he different from the majority of men? Then he
thought&mdash;as others before him had thought&mdash;that, since
the race must be preserved, the primal impulses should not be
denied. They outlived everything; they rallied from
shock&mdash;even death; they persisted until extinction; and here
was this sweet woman with all her gracious loveliness near him. He
loved her! Yes, strange as it seemed even then to him, Truedale
acknowledged that he loved her with the love, unlike yet like the
love that had been too rudely awakened in the lonely woods when he
had been still incapable of understanding it.</p>
<p>Then the storm outside reached his consciousness and awakened
memories that hurt and stung him.</p>
<p>No. He was not as many men who could take and take and find
excuse. The very sincerity of the past and future must prove
itself, now, in this throbbing, vital present. Only so could he
justify himself and his belief in goodness. He must open his heart
and soul to the woman beside him. There was no other
alternative.</p>
<p>But first they dined together across the hall. Truedale noted
every special dish&mdash;the meal was composed of his favourite
viands. The intimacy of sitting opposite Lynda, the smiling
pleasure of old Thomas who served them, combined to lure him again
from his stern sense of duty.</p>
<p>Why? Why? his yearning pleaded. Why should he destroy his own
future happiness and that of this sweet, innocent woman for a
whim&mdash;that was what he tried to term it&mdash;of conscience?
Why, there were men, thousands of them, who would call him by a
harsher name than he cared to own, if he followed such a course;
and yet&mdash;then Truedale looked across at Lynda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman should have clear vision and choice,&rdquo; his
reason commanded, and to this his love agreed.</p>
<p>But alone with Lynda, in the library later, the conflict was
renewed. Never had she been so sweet, so kind. The storm beat
against the house and instead of interfering, seemed to hold them
close and&mdash;together. It no longer aroused in Truedale
recollections that smarted. It was like an old familiar guide
leading his thought into ways sacred and happy. Then suddenly, out
of a consciousness that knew neither doubt nor fear, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I, Lyn, were never afraid of truth, were
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was knitting again&mdash;knitting feverishly and
desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyn&mdash;I want to tell you&mdash;all about it! About
something you must know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very quietly now, Lynda rolled her work together and tossed it,
needles and all, upon the glowing logs. She was done, forever, with
subterfuge and she knew it. The wool curled, blackened, and gave
forth a scorched smell before the red coals subdued it. Then, with
a straight, uplifted look:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready, Con.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just before I broke down and went away, Brace once told
me that my life had no background, no colour. Lynda, it is of that
background about which you do not know, that I want to
speak.&rdquo; He waited a moment, then went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went away&mdash;to the loneliest, the most beautiful
place I had ever seen. For a time there seemed to be nobody in the
world but the man with whom I lived and me. He liked and trusted
me&mdash;I betrayed his trust!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda caught her breath and gave a little exclamation of
dissent, wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;betrayed him, Con! I cannot believe that. Go
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I betrayed his trust. He left me and went into the
deep woods to hunt. He put everything in my care&mdash;everything.
He was gone nearly three weeks. No one knew of my existence. They
are like that down there. If you are an outsider you do not matter.
I had arrived at dark; I was sent for a certain purpose; that was
all that mattered. I began and ended with the man who was my host
and who had been told to&mdash;to keep me secret.&rdquo; Truedale
was gripping the arms of his chair and his words came punctuated by
sharp pauses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, into that solitude, came a young girl.
Remember, she did not know of my existence. We&mdash;discovered
each other like creatures in a new world. There are no words to
describe her&mdash;I cannot even attempt it, Lynda. I ruined her
life. That&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bald, crushing truth was out. For a moment the man Lynda
Kendall knew and loved seemed hiding behind this monster the
confession had called forth. A lesser woman would have shrunk in
affright, but not Lynda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That is not all,&rdquo; she whispered hoarsely,
putting her hands out as though pushing something tangible aside
until she could reach Conning. &ldquo;I demand the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What matters it?&rdquo; Truedale spoke bitterly.
&ldquo;If I tell how and why, can that alter the&mdash;fact? Oh! I
have had my hours of explaining and justifying and glossing over;
but I&rsquo;ve come at last to the point where I see myself as I am
and I shall never argue the thing again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Con, you have shown me the man as man might see him; I
must&mdash;I must have him as a woman&mdash;as his God&mdash;must
see him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think it possible for me to grant this?
You&mdash;you, Lynda, would you have me put up a defense for what I
did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But I would have you throw all the light upon it that
you can. I want to see&mdash;for myself. I will not accept the
hideous skeleton you have hung before me. Con, I have never really
known but five men in my life; but women&mdash;women have lain
heart deep along my way ever since&mdash;I learned to know my
mother! Not only for yourself, but for that girl who drifted into
your solitude, I demand light&mdash;all that you can give
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now Truedale breathed hard and the muscles of his face
twitched. He was about to lay bare the inscrutable, the holy thing
of his life, fearing that even the woman near him could not be
just. He had accepted his own fate, so he thought; he meant not to
whine or complain, but how was he to live his life if Lynda failed
to agree with him&mdash;where Nella-Rose was concerned?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you&mdash;can you&mdash;do what I ask,
Con?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;loved her? She loved you&mdash;Con?&rdquo;
Lynda strove to smooth the way, not so much for Truedale as for
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! I found her in my cabin one day when I returned from
a long tramp. She had decked herself out in my bathrobe and the old
fez. Not knowing anything about me, she was horribly frightened
when I came upon her. At first she seemed nothing but a
child&mdash;she took me by storm. We met in the woods later. I read
to her, taught her, played with her&mdash;I, who had never played
in my life before. Then suddenly she became a woman! She knew no
law but her own; she was full of courage and daring and a splendid
disregard for conventions as&mdash;as we all know them. For her,
they simply did not exist. I&mdash;I was willing and eager to cast
my future hopes of happiness with hers&mdash;God knows I was
sincere in that!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then came a night of storm&mdash;such as this. Can you
imagine it in the black forests where small streams become rivers
in a moment, carrying all before them as they plunge and roar down
the mountain sides? Dangers of all sorts threatened and, in the
midst of that storm, something occurred that involved me! I had
sent Nella-Rose&mdash;that was her name&mdash;away earlier in the
day. I could not trust myself. But she came back to warn me. It
meant risking everything, for her people were abroad that night
bent on ugly business; she had to betray them in order to save me.
To have turned her adrift would have meant death, or worse. She
remained with me nearly a week&mdash;she and I alone in that cabin
and cut off from the world&mdash;she and I! There was only myself
to depend upon&mdash;and, Lynda, I failed again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Con&mdash;you meant to&mdash;to marry her; you meant
that&mdash;from the first?&rdquo; Lynda had forgotten herself, her
suffering. She was struggling to save something more precious than
her love; she was holding to her faith in Truedale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God! yes. It was the one thing I wanted&mdash;the
one thing I planned. In my madness it did not seem to matter much
except as a safeguard for her&mdash;but I had no other thought or
intention. We meant to go to a minister as soon as the storm
released us. Then came the telegram about Uncle William, and the
minister was killed during the storm. Lynda, I wanted to bring
Nella-Rose to you just as she was, but she would not come. I left
my address and told her to send for me if she needed me&mdash;I
meant to return as soon as I could, anyway. I would have left
anything for her. She never sent for me&mdash;and the very day I
left&mdash;she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Con? I must know all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lynda, before God I believe something drove the child to
it; you must not&mdash;you shall not judge her. But she went, the
very night I left, to a man&mdash;a man of the hills&mdash;who had
loved her all his life. He was in danger; he escaped, taking her
with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I do <i>not</i> believe it!&rdquo; The words rang
out sharply, defiantly. Woman was in arms for woman. The loyalty
that few men admit confronted Truedale now. It seemed to glorify
the darkness about him. He had no further fear for Nella-Rose and
he bowed his head before Lynda&rsquo;s blazing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;but oh! Lyn, I
went back to make sure. I had the truth from her own father. And
with all&mdash;she stands to this day, in my memory, guiltless of
the monstrous wrong she seemed to commit; and so she will always
stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since then, Lynda, I have lived a new piece of life; the
past lies back there and it is dead, dead. I would not have told
you this but for one great and tremendous thing. You will not
understand this; no woman could. A man could, but not a woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I once loved&mdash;in another way&mdash;that child of
the hills, I love you, the one woman of my manhood&rsquo;s clearer
vision. Because of that love&mdash;I had to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale looked up and met the eyes that searched his soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; Lynda faltered. &ldquo;I do not
understand, but I believe you. Go away now, Con, I want to
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose at once and bent over her. &ldquo;God bless you,
Lyn,&rdquo; was all he said.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>Two days, then three passed. Lynda tried to send for
Truedale&mdash;tried to believe that she saw clearly at last, but
having decided that she was ready she was again lost in doubt and
plunged into a new struggle.</p>
<p>She neglected her work and grew pale and listless. Brace was
worried and bewildered. He had never seen his sister in like mood
and, missing Conning from the house, he drew, finally, his own
conclusions.</p>
<p>One day, it was nearly a week after Truedale&rsquo;s call, Brace
came upon his sister in the workshop over the extension. She was
sitting on the window-ledge looking out into the old garden where a
magnolia tree was in full bloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heigho, boy!&rdquo; she said, welcoming him with her
eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just discovered that spring is here.
I&rsquo;ve always been ready for it before. This year it has taken
me by surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brace came close to her and put his hands on her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, girl?&rdquo; he asked in his
quick, blunt way.</p>
<p>The tears came to Lynda&rsquo;s eyes, but she did not
shrink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;I&mdash;I want to
marry Con and&mdash;I do not dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kendall dropped in the nearest chair, and stared blankly at his
sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind being a bit more&mdash;well, more
explicit?&rdquo; he faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask you&mdash;some questions, dear.
Will you&mdash;tell me true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo; Kendall passed his hand
through his hair; it seemed to relieve the tension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace, can a man truly love many times? Perhaps not
many&mdash;but twice&mdash;truly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;he can!&rdquo; Brace asserted boldly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in love a dozen times myself. I always put
it to the coffee-urn test&mdash;that settles it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace, I am in earnest. Do not joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joke? Good Lord! I tell you, Lyn, I am in <i>deadly</i>
earnest&mdash;deadlier than you know. When a man puts his love
three hundred and sixty-five times a year, in fancy, behind his
coffee-urn, he gets his bearings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never grown up, Brace, and I feel as
old&mdash;as old as both your grandmothers. I do not
mean&mdash;puppy-love; I mean the love that cuts deep in a
man&rsquo;s soul. Can it cut twice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it couldn&rsquo;t, it would be good-bye to the future
of the race!&rdquo; And now Kendall had the world&rsquo;s weary
knowledge in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman&mdash;cannot understand that, Lyn. She must trust
if she loves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The universal language of men struck Lynda
like a strange tongue. Had she been living all her life, she
wondered, like a foreigner&mdash;understanding merely by signs? And
now that she was close&mdash;was confronting a situation that
vitally affected her future&mdash;must she, like other women,
trust, trust?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has all this to do with Con?&rdquo;
Kendall&rsquo;s voice roused Lynda sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;everything,&rdquo; she said in her simple,
frank way, &ldquo;he&mdash;he is offering me a second love,
Brace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Kendall thought his sister was resorting to sarcasm
or frivolity. But one look at her unsmiling face and shadow-touched
eyes convinced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hardly are the woman to whom dregs should be
offered,&rdquo; he said slowly, and then, &ldquo;But Con! Good
Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace, now I am speaking the woman&rsquo;s language,
perhaps you may not be able to understand me, but I know Con is not
offering me dregs&mdash;I do not think he has any dregs in his
nature; he is offering me the best, the truest love of his life. I
know it! I know it! The love that would bring my greatest joy and
his best good and&mdash;yet I am afraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kendall went over and stood close beside his sister again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;and still are
afraid? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clear eyes looked up pathetically. &ldquo;Because Con may
not know, and I may not be able to make him know&mdash;make
him&mdash;forget!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Kendall was never to forget
the magnolia tree in its gorgeous, pink bloom; the droop of his
strong, fine sister! Sharply he recalled the night long ago when
Truedale groaned and threw his letters on the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyn, I hardly dare ask this, knowing you as I
do&mdash;you are not the sort to compromise with honour selfishly
or idiotically&mdash;but, Lyn, the&mdash;the other love, it was
not&mdash;an evil thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tears sprang to Lynda&rsquo;s eyes and she flung her arms
around her brother&rsquo;s neck and holding him so whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no! At least I can understand that. It was
the&mdash;the most beautiful and tender tragedy. That is the
trouble. It was so&mdash;wonderful, that I fear no man can ever
quite forget and take the new love without a backward look. And oh!
Brace, I must have&mdash;my own! Men cannot always understand women
when they say this. They think, when we say we want our own lives,
that it means lives running counter to theirs. This is not so. We
want, we must choose&mdash;but the best of us want the common life
that draws close to the heart of things; we want to go with our men
and along their way. Our way and theirs are the <i>same</i> way,
when love is big enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyn&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t a man on God&rsquo;s earth
worthy of&mdash;you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace, look at me&mdash;answer true. Am I such that a man
could really want me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked long at her. Bravely he strove to forget the blood tie
that held them. He regarded her from the viewpoint that another man
might have. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. As God hears me, Lyn&mdash;yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped her head upon his shoulder and wept as if grief
instead of joy were sweeping over her. Presently she raised her
tear-wet face and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to marry Con, dear, as soon as he wants
me. I hate to say this, Brace, but it is a little as if Conning had
come home to me from an honourable war&mdash;a bit mutilated. I
must try to get used to him and I will! I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kendall held her to him close. &ldquo;Lyn, I never knew until
this moment how much I have to humbly thank God for. Oh! if men
only could see ahead, young fellows I mean, they would not come to
a woman&mdash;mutilated. I haven&rsquo;t much to offer, heaven
knows, but&mdash;well, Lyn, I can offer a clear record to some
woman&mdash;some day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that day Lynda thought of the future. Sitting in her
workshop with the toy-like emblems of her craft at hand she thought
and thought. It seemed to her, struggling alone, that men and
women, after all, walked through life&mdash;largely apart. They had
built bridges with love and necessity and over them they crossed to
touch each other for a space, but oh! how she longed for a common
highway where she and Con could walk always together! She wanted
this so much, so much!</p>
<p>At five o&rsquo;clock she telephoned to Truedale. She knew he
generally went to his apartment at that hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I want to see you, Con,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Lyn. Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt the answer meant much, so she paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After dinner, Con, and come right up to&mdash;to my
workshop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be there&mdash;early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda was never more her merry old self than she was at dinner;
but she was genuinely relieved when Brace told her he was going
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, Lyn?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;go up to my workshop. I&rsquo;ve neglected
things horribly, lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that night work was taboo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rarely work at night, Brace. And you&mdash;where are
you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to Morrell&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Morrell&rsquo;s sister has come from the West, Lyn.
She&rsquo;s very interesting. She&rsquo;s <i>voted</i>, and it
hasn&rsquo;t hurt her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should it? And&rdquo;&mdash;Lynda came around the
table and paused as she was about to go out of the room &ldquo;I
wonder if she could pass the coffee-urn test, on a
pinch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kendall coloured vividly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking more
of my end of the table since I saw her than I ever have before in
my life. It isn&rsquo;t all coffee-urn, Lyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it isn&rsquo;t! I must see this little womanly
Lochinvar at once. Is she pretty&mdash;pretty as Mrs.
John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. I haven&rsquo;t thought.
She&rsquo;s so different from&mdash;every one. She&rsquo;s little
but makes you think big. She&rsquo;s always saying things you
remember afterward, but she doesn&rsquo;t talk much.
She&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s got light hair and blue eyes!&rdquo;
This triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope she&mdash;dresses well?&rdquo; This with a
twinkle, for Kendall was keen about the details of a woman&rsquo;s
dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must, or I would have noticed.&rdquo; Then, upon
reflection, &ldquo;or perhaps I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-night, Brace, and&mdash;give Mrs. John my
love. Poor dear! she came up to ask me yesterday if I could make a
small room <i>look</i> spacious! You see, John likes to have
everything cluttered&mdash;close to his touch. She wants him to
have his way and at the same time she wants to breathe, too. Her
West is in her blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do about it, Lyn?&rdquo; Kendall
lighted a cigar and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I managed to give a prairie-like suggestion of
openness to her living-room plan and I told her to make John reach
for a few things. It would do him good and save her soul
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she&mdash;what did she say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she laughed. She has such a pretty laugh. Good-night,
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Lynda went upstairs to her quiet, dim room. It was a
warmish night, with a moon that shone through the open space in the
rear. The lot had not been built upon and the white path that had
seemed to lure old William Truedale away from life now stretched
before Lynda Kendall, leading into life. Whatever doubts and fears
she had known were put away. In her soft thin dress, standing by
the open window, she was the gladdest creature one could wish to
see. And so Truedale found her. He knew that only one reason had
caused Lynda to meet him as she was now doing. It
was&mdash;surrender! Across the moon-lighted room he went to her
with opened arms, and when she came to meet him and lifted her face
he kissed her reverently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if you have thought?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done nothing else in the ages since I last saw
you, Con.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are not&mdash;afraid? You, who should have the
best the world has to offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid; and I&mdash;have the best&mdash;the very
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Truedale kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when&mdash;may I come home&mdash;to stay?&rdquo; he
asked presently, knowing full well that the old home must be
theirs.</p>
<p>Lynda looked up and smiled radiantly. &ldquo;I had hoped,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;that I might have the honour of declining the
little apartment. I&rsquo;m so glad, Con, dear, that you want to
come home to stay and will not have to be&mdash;forced here!&rdquo;
And at that moment Lynda had no thought of the money. Bigger,
deeper things held her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;our wedding day, Lyn? Surely it may be
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see. Of course I&rsquo;m a woman, Con, and
therefore I must think of clothes. And I would like&mdash;oh! very
much&mdash;to be married in a certain little church across the
river. I found it once on a tramp. There are vines running wild
over it&mdash;pink roses. And roses come in early June,
Con.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dearest, this is only&mdash;March.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have&mdash;the roses, Con.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was decided.</p>
<p>Late that night, in the stillness of the five little rooms of
the big apartment, Truedale thought of his past and his future.</p>
<p>How splendid Lynda had been. Not a word of all that he had told
her, and yet full well he realized how she had battled with it! She
had accepted it and him! And for such love and faith his life would
be only too short to prove his learning of his hard lesson. The man
he now was sternly confronted the man he had once been, and then
Truedale renounced the former forever&mdash;renounced him with
pity, not with scorn. His only chance of being worthy of the love
that had come into his life now, was to look upon the past as a
stepping stone. Unless it could be that, it would be a bottomless
pit.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p>The roses came early that June. Truedale and Lynda went often on
their walks to the little church nestling deep among the trees in
the Jersey town. They got acquainted with the old minister and
finally they set their wedding day. They, with Brace, went over
early on the morning. Lynda was in her travelling gown for, after a
luncheon, she and Truedale were going to the New Hampshire
mountains. It was such a day as revived the reputation of June, and
somehow the minister, steeped in the conventions of his office,
could not let things rest entirely in the hands of the very
eccentric young people who had won his consent to marry them. An
organist, practising, stayed on, and always Lynda was to recall,
when she thought of her wedding day, those tender notes that rose
and fell like a stream upon which the sacred words of the simple
service floated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Voice That Breathed O&rsquo;er Eden&rdquo; was what
the unseen musician played. He seemed detached, impersonal, and
only the repeated strains gave evidence of his sympathy. An old
woman had wandered into the church and sat near the door with a
rapt, wistful look on her wrinkled face. Near the altar was a
little child, a tiny girl with a bunch of wayside flowers in her
fat, moist hand.</p>
<p>Lynda paused and whispered something to the little maid and
then, as she went forward, Truedale noticed that the child was
beside Lynda, a shabby, wee maid of honour!</p>
<p>It was very quaint, very touchingly pretty, but the scene
overawed the baby and when the last words were said and Truedale
had kissed his wife they noticed that the little one was in tears.
Lynda bent over her full of tenderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I want&mdash;my mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, sweetheart; so do I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wet eyes were raised in wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is your mother, baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up&mdash;up&mdash;the hill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, so is mine, but you will find yours&mdash;first.
Don&rsquo;t cry, sweetheart. See, here is a little ring. It is too
large for you now, but let your mother keep it, and when you are
big enough, wear it&mdash;and remember&mdash;me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dazzled by the gift, the child smiled up radiantly.
&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
mother&mdash;and I won&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later that same golden day, when Kendall bade his sister and
Truedale good-bye at the station he had the look on his face that
he used to have when, as a child, he was wont to wonder why he had
to be brave because he was a boy.</p>
<p>It made Lynda laugh, even while a lump came in her throat. Then,
as in the old days, she sought to recompense him, without relenting
as to the code.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll miss us, dear old fellow, but
we&rsquo;ll soon be back and&rdquo;&mdash;she put her lips to his
ear and whispered&mdash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s the little sister of
the Morrells; play with her until we come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are times in life that stand forth as if specially
designed, and cause one to wonder, if after all, a personal God
isn&rsquo;t directing affairs for the individual. They surely could
not have just happened, those weeks in the mountains. So warm and
still and cloudless they were for early June. And then there was a
moon for a little while&mdash;a calm, wonderful moon that sent its
fair light through the tall trees like a benediction. After that
there were stars&mdash;millions of them&mdash;each in its place
surrounded by that blue-blackness that is luminous and unearthly.
Securing a guide, Truedale and Lynda sought their own way and
slept, at night, in wayside shelters by their own campfires. They
had no definite destination; they simply wandered like pilgrims,
taking the day&rsquo;s dole with joyous hearts and going to their
sleep at night with healthy weariness.</p>
<p>Only once during those weeks did they speak of that past of
Truedale&rsquo;s that Lynda had accepted in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; Truedale said&mdash;she was sitting
beside him by the outdoor fire&mdash;&ldquo;I want you always to
remember that I am more grateful than words can express for
your&mdash;bigness, your wonderful understanding. I did not expect
that even you, Lyn, could be&mdash;so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She trembled a little&mdash;he remembered that
afterward&mdash;he felt her against his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think&mdash;I know,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;that
women consider the <i>effect</i> of such&mdash;things, Con. Had the
experience been low, it would have left its mark; as it is I am
sure&mdash;well, it has not darkened your vision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Lyn, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And lately, I have been thinking of her, Con&mdash;that
little Nella-Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;have? You <i>could</i>, Lyn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. At first I couldn&rsquo;t possibly
comprehend&mdash;I do not now, really, but I find myself believing,
in spite of my inability to understand, that the experience has
cast such a light upon her way, poor child, that&mdash;off in some
rude mountain home&mdash;she has a little fairer space than some.
Con, knowing you, I believe you could not have&mdash;lowered her.
She went back to her natural love&mdash;it must have been a strong
call&mdash;but I shall never believe her depraved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyn,&rdquo; Truedale&rsquo;s voice was husky, &ldquo;once
you made me reconciled to my uncle&rsquo;s death&mdash;it was the
way you put it&mdash;and now you have made me dare to
be&mdash;happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men never grow up!&rdquo; Lynda pressed her face to his
shoulder, &ldquo;they make a bluff at caring for us and defending
us and all the rest&mdash;but we understand, we understand! I think
women mother men always even when they rely upon them most, as I do
upon you! It&rsquo;s so splendid to think, when we go home, of the
great things we are going to do&mdash;together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A letter from Brace, eventually, made them turn their faces
homeward. It was late July then.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>LYN, DEAR:</p>
<p>When you can conveniently give me a thought, do. And when are
you coming back? I hope I shall not shock you unduly&mdash;but
it&rsquo;s that little sister of the Morrells that is the matter,
Elizabeth Arnold&mdash;Betty we call her. I&rsquo;ve got to marry
her as soon as I can. I&rsquo;ll never be able to do any serious
business again until I get her behind the coffee-urn. She haunts me
day and night and then when I see her&mdash;she laughs at me!
We&rsquo;ve been over to look at that church where you and Con were
married. Betty likes it, but prefers her own folk to stray old
women and lost kids. We think September would be a jolly month to
be married in, but Betty refuses to set a day until she finds out
if she approves of my people! That&rsquo;s the way <i>she</i> puts
it. She says she wants to find out if you believe in women&rsquo;s
voting, for if you don&rsquo;t, she knows she never could get on
with you. She believes that the thing that makes women opposed,
does other things to them&mdash;rather unpleasant, unfriendly
things.</p>
<p>I told her your sentiments and then she asked about Con. She
says she wouldn&rsquo;t trust the freest woman in the East if she
were married to a slave-believing man.</p>
<p>By all this you will judge what a comical little cuss Betty is,
but all the same I am quite serious in urging you to come home
before I grow desperate.</p>
<p>BRACE.</p>
</div>
<p>Truedale looked at Lynda in blank amazement. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
forgotten about the sister,&rdquo; he said, inanely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, dear, we&rsquo;ll <i>have</i> to go home. I
remember once when we were quite little, Brace and I, mother had
taken me for a visit and left him at home. He sent a letter to
mother&mdash;it was in printing&mdash;&lsquo;You better come
back,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;You better come in three days or
I&rsquo;ll do something.&rsquo; We got there on the fourth day and
we found that he had broken the rocking chair in which mother used
to put him to sleep when he was good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little rowdy!&rdquo; Truedale laughed. &ldquo;I hope
he got a walloping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Mother cried a little, had the chair mended, and
always said she was sorry that she had not got home on the third
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Well, Lyn, let&rsquo;s go home to him. I
don&rsquo;t know what he might break, but perhaps we couldn&rsquo;t
mend it, so we&rsquo;ll take no chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale and Lynda had walked rather giddily upon the heights;
the splendour of stars and the warm touch of the sun had been very
near them; but once they descended to the paths of plain duty they
were not surprised to find that they lay along a pleasant valley
and were warmed by the brightness of the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;home, now!&rdquo; whispered Truedale as
he let himself and Lynda in at the front door, &ldquo;I wish Uncle
William were here to welcome us. How he loved you, Lyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a flood of joy memory overcame Lynda. This was how William
Truedale had loved her&mdash;this luxury of home&mdash;and then she
looked at Truedale and almost told him of the money, the complete
assurance of the old man&rsquo;s love and trust. But of a sudden it
became impossible, though why, Lynda could not have said. She
shrank from what she had once believed would be her crowning joy;
she decided to leave the matter entirely with Dr. McPherson.</p>
<p>After all, she concluded, it should be Con&rsquo;s right to
bring to her this last touching proof of his uncle&rsquo;s love and
desire. How proud he would be! How they would laugh over it all
when they both knew the secret!</p>
<p>So the subject was not referred to and a day or so later Betty
Arnold entered their lives, and so intense was their interest in
her and her affairs that personal matters were, for the moment,
overlooked.</p>
<p>Lynda went first to call upon Betty alone. If she were to be
disappointed, she wanted time to readjust herself before she
encountered other eyes. Betty Arnold, too, was alone in her
sister&rsquo;s drawing room when Lynda was announced. The two girls
looked long and searchingly at each other, then Lynda put her hands
out impulsively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really too good to be true!&rdquo; was all she
could manage as she looked at the fair, slight girl and cast doubt
off forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; echoed Betty. &ldquo;Whew! but
this is the sort of thing that ages one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it have mattered, Betty, whether I was pleased or
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lynda, it would&mdash;awfully! You see, all my life
I&rsquo;ve been independent until I met Brace and now I want
everything that belongs to him. His love and mine collided but it
didn&rsquo;t shock us to blindness, it awakened us&mdash;body and
soul. When that happens, everything matters&mdash;everything that
belongs to him and me. I knew you liked Mollie, and John is an old
friend; they&rsquo;re all I&rsquo;ve got, and so you see if you and
I hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;liked each other, it would have
been&mdash;tragic. Now let&rsquo;s sit down and have tea.
Isn&rsquo;t it great that we won&rsquo;t have to choke over
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty presided at the small table so daintily and graciously
that her occasional lapses into slang were like the dartings of a
particularly frisky little animal from the beaten track of
conventions. She and Lynda grew confidential in a half hour and
felt as if they had known each other for years at the close of the
call. Just as Lynda was reluctantly leaving, Mrs. Morrell came in.
She was darker, more dignified than her sister, but like her in
voice and laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mollie, I wish I had told you to stay another
hour,&rdquo; Betty exclaimed, going to her sister and kissing her.
&ldquo;And oh! Mollie, Lynda likes me! I&rsquo;ll confess to you
both now that I have lain awake nights dreading this
ordeal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Lynda met Brace that evening she was amused at his drawn
face and tense voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you like her?&rdquo; he asked feebly and at that
moment Lynda realized how futile a subterfuge would have been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace, I love her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Brace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it. It would have gone hard with me if you
hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Truedale, Betty presented another aspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can trust women with your emotions about men,&rdquo;
she confided to Lynda, &ldquo;but not men! I wouldn&rsquo;t let
Brace know for anything how my love for him hobbles me; and if your
Con&mdash;by the way, he&rsquo;s a great deal nicer than I
expected&mdash;should guess my abject state, he&rsquo;d go to Brace
and&mdash;put him wise! That&rsquo;s why men have got where they
are to-day&mdash;standing together. And then Brace might begin at
once to bully me. You see, Lynda, when a husband gets the upper
hand it&rsquo;s often because he&rsquo;s reinforced by all the
knowledge his male friends hand out to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale met Betty first at the dinner&mdash;the little family
dinner Lynda gave for her. Morrell and his wife. Brace and Betty,
himself and Lynda.</p>
<p>In a trailing blue gown Betty looked quite stately and she
carried her blond head high. She sparkled away through dinner and
proved her happy faculty of fitting in, perfectly. It was a very
merry meal, and later, by the library fire, Conning found himself
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with his future sister-in-law. She
amused him hugely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; he said teasingly, &ldquo;I can hardly
believe that you believe in the equality of the sexes.&rdquo; They
were attacking that problem at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Betty looked quaintly demure.
&ldquo;I believe in the superiority of men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. That&rsquo;s why I want all women to have the same
chance that men have had to get superior. I&mdash;I want my sisters
to get there, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There? Just where?&rdquo; Truedale began to think the
girl frivolous; but her charm held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where their qualifications best fit them to be.
I&rsquo;m going to tell you a secret&mdash;I&rsquo;m tremendously
religious! I believe God knows, better than men, about women; I
want&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t want to seem flippant&mdash;but
truly I&rsquo;d like to hear God speak for himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a common-sense argument,
anyway,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I suppose we men are afraid to
trust any one else; we don&rsquo;t want to&mdash;lose
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if you could!&rdquo; Betty held her small, white hand
out to the dog lying at her feet. &ldquo;As if we didn&rsquo;t
know, that whatever we don&rsquo;t want, we do want you. Why, you
are our&mdash;job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale threw his head back and laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
like a whiff of your big mountain air,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I always will be,&rdquo; Betty replied softly and
earnestly, &ldquo;I must keep&mdash;free, no matter what happens. I
must keep what I am, or how can I expect to keep&mdash;Brace? He
loved <i>this</i> me. Marriage doesn&rsquo;t perform a miracle,
does it&mdash;Conning? please let me call you that. Lynda has told
me how she and you believe in two lives, not one narrow little
life. It&rsquo;s splendid. And now I am going to tell you another
secret. I&rsquo;ll have to let Lynda in on this, too, she must help
me. I have a little money of my very own&mdash;I earned every cent
of it. I am going to buy a tiny bit of ground, I&rsquo;ve picked it
out&mdash;it&rsquo;s across the river in the woods. I&rsquo;m going
to build a house, not much of a one, a very small one, and
I&rsquo;m going to call it&mdash;The Refuge. When I cannot find
myself, when I get lost, after I&rsquo;m married, and am trying to
be everything to Brace, I&rsquo;m going to run away to&mdash;The
Refuge!&rdquo; The blue eyes were shining &ldquo;And nobody can
come there, not even Brace, except by invitation. I
think&rdquo;&mdash;very softly&mdash;&ldquo;I think all women
should have a&mdash;a Refuge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale found himself impressed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very
wise little woman,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One has to be, sometimes,&rdquo; came the slow words. And
at that moment all doubt of Betty&rsquo;s serious-mindedness
departed.</p>
<p>Brace joined them presently. He looked as if he had been
straining at a leash since dinner time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Con,&rdquo; he said, laying his hand on the light head
bending over the dog, &ldquo;now that you have talked and laughed
with Betty, what have you got to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations, Ken, with all my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Betty&rdquo;&mdash;there was a new tone in
Kendall&rsquo;s voice&mdash;&ldquo;Mollie has said you may walk
back with me. The taxi would stifle us. There&rsquo;s a moon, dear,
and a star or two&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if that mattered!&rdquo; Betty broke in.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very, very happy. Brace, you&rsquo;ve got a nice,
sensible family. They agree with me in everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The weeks passed rapidly. Betty&rsquo;s affairs absorbed them
all, though she laughingly urged them to leave her alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite awful enough to feel yourself being
carried along by a deluge,&rdquo; she jokingly said, &ldquo;without
hearing the cheers from the banks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mollie Morrell flung herself heart and soul into the
arranging of the wardrobe&mdash;playing big sister for the first
and only time in her life. She was older than Betty, but the
younger girl had always swayed the elder.</p>
<p>And Lynda became fascinated with the little bungalow across the
river, known as The Refuge.</p>
<p>The original fancy touched her imagination and she put other
work aside while she vied with Betty for expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found an old man and woman, near by,&rdquo;
Betty said one day, &ldquo;they were afraid they would have to go
to the poor-house, although both are able to do a little. I&rsquo;m
going to put them in my bungalow&mdash;the two little upstair rooms
shall be theirs. When I run down to find myself it will be homey to
see the two shining, old faces there to greet me. They are not a
bit cringing; I think they know how much they will mean to me. They
consider me rather immoral, I know, but that doesn&rsquo;t
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then in early October Brace and Betty were married in the
church across the river. Red and gold autumn leaves were falling
where earlier the roses had clambered; it was a brisk, cool day
full of sun and shade and the wedding was more to the old
clergyman&rsquo;s taste. The organist was in his place, his music
discriminately chosen, there were guests and flowers and discreet
costumes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More as it should be,&rdquo; thought the serene pastor;
but Lynda missed the kindly old woman who had drifted in on her
wedding day, and the small, tearful girl who had wanted her
mother.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p>There are spaces in all lives that seem so surrounded by safety
and established conditions that one cannot conceive of change.
Those particular spots may know light and shade of passing events
but it seems that they cannot, of themselves, be affected. So
Truedale and Lynda had considered their lives at that period. They
were supremely happy, they were gloriously busy&mdash;and that
meant that they both recognized limitations. They took each day as
it came and let it go at the end with a half-conscious knowledge
that it had been too short.</p>
<p>Then one late October afternoon Truedale tapped on the door of
Lynda&rsquo;s workshop and to her cheery &ldquo;come,&rdquo;
entered, closed the door after him, and sat down. He was very white
and sternly serious. Lynda looked at him questioningly but did not
speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen Dr. McPherson,&rdquo; Conning said
presently, &ldquo;he sent for me. He&rsquo;s been away, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not known&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; Then Lynda
remembered!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lynda, did you know&mdash;of my uncle&rsquo;s&mdash;will
before his death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Con.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something cold and death-like clutched Lynda&rsquo;s heart. It
was as if an icy wave had swept warmth and safety before it,
leaving her aghast and afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me&mdash;I could not go into this with
McPherson, somehow; he didn&rsquo;t see it my way,
naturally&mdash;will you tell me what would have become of
the&mdash;the fortune had I not married you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deathly whiteness of Lynda&rsquo;s face did not stay
Truedale&rsquo;s hard words; he was not thinking of her&mdash;even
of himself; he was thinking of the irony of fate in the broad
sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The money would have&mdash;come to me.&rdquo; Then, as if
to divert any further misunderstanding. &ldquo;And when I refused
it&mdash;it would have reverted to charities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. And you did this for me, Lyn! How little even you
understood. Now that I have the cursed money I do not know what to
do with it&mdash;how to get rid of it. Still it was like you,
Lynda, to sacrifice yourself in order that I might have what you
thought was my due. You always did that, from girlhood. I might
have known no other woman could have done what you have done, no
such woman as you, Lyn, without a mighty motive; but you did not
know me, really!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, looking at Lynda, it was like looking at a dead
face&mdash;a face from which warmth and light had been
stricken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;do not know what you&mdash;mean, Con,&rdquo; she
said, vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being you, Lyn, you couldn&rsquo;t have taken the money,
yourself, particularly if you had declined to marry me. A lesser
woman would have done it without a qualm, feeling justified in
outwitting so cruel a thing as the bequest; but not you! You saw no
other way, so you&mdash;you with your high ideals and clear
beliefs&mdash;you married the man I am&mdash;in order to&mdash;to
give me&mdash;my own. Oh, Lyn, what a sacrifice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Lynda rose from her chair and, by a wide
gesture, swept the marks of her trade far from her. In so doing she
seemed to make space to breathe and think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I am the sort of girl who would sell herself
for anything&mdash;even for the justice I might think was
yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sell yourself? Thank God, between us, Lynda, that does
not enter in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have, were I the woman your words imply. I had
nothing to gain by marrying you, nothing! Nothing&mdash;that
is&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;what you are unable to see.&rdquo; And
then, so suddenly that Truedale could not stop her, Lynda almost
ran from the room.</p>
<p>For an hour Truedale sat in her empty shop and waited. He dared
not seek her and he realized, at last, that she was not coming back
to him. His frame of mind was so abject and personal that he could
not get Lynda&rsquo;s point of view. He could not, as yet, see the
insult he had offered, because he had set her so high and himself
so low. He saw her only as the girl and woman who, her life
through, had put herself aside and considered others. He saw
himself in the light such a woman as he believed Lynda to be would
regard him. He might have known, he bitterly acknowledged, that
Lynda could not have overlooked in her pure woman soul the lapse of
his earlier life. He remembered how, that night of his confession,
she had begged to be alone&mdash;to think! Later, her
silence&mdash;oh! he understood it now. It was her only safeguard.
And that once, in the woods, when he had blindly believed in his
great joy&mdash;how she had solemnly made the best of the
experience that was too deep in both hearts to be resurrected. What
a fool he had been to dream that so wrong a step as he had once
taken could lead him to perfect peace. Thinking these thoughts, how
could he, as yet, comprehend the wrong he was doing Lynda? Why, he
was grieving over her, almost breaking his heart in his desire to
do something&mdash;anything&mdash;to free her from the results of
her useless sacrifice.</p>
<p>At six o&rsquo;clock Truedale went downstairs, but the house was
empty. Lynda had gone, taking all sense of home with her. He did
not wait to see what the dinner hour might bring about; he could
not trust himself just then. Indeed&mdash;having blasted every
familiar landmark&mdash;he was utterly and hopelessly lost. He
couldn&rsquo;t imagine how he was ever to find his way back to
Lynda, and yet they would have to meet&mdash;have to consider.</p>
<p>Lynda, after leaving her workshop, had only one desire&mdash;she
wanted Betty more than she wanted anything else. She put on her hat
and coat and started headlong for her brother&rsquo;s apartment
farther uptown. She felt she must get there before Brace arrived
and lay her trouble before the astoundingly clear, unfaltering mind
and heart of the little woman who, so short a time ago, had come
into their lives. But after a few blocks, Lynda&rsquo;s steps
halted. If this were just her own trouble&mdash;but what trouble is
just one&rsquo;s own?&mdash;she need not hesitate; but how could
she reveal what was deepest and most unfailing in her soul to any
living person&mdash;even to Betty of the unhesitating vision?</p>
<p>Presently Lynda retraced her steps. The calm autumn night
soothed and protected her. She looked up at the stars and thought
of the old words: &ldquo;Why so hot, little man, why so hot?&rdquo;
Why, indeed? And then in the still dimness&mdash;for she had turned
into the side streets&mdash;she let Truedale come into her thoughts
to the exclusion, for the moment, of her own bitter wrong. She
looked back at his strange, lonely boyhood with so little in it
that could cause him to view justly his uncle&rsquo;s last deed.
She remembered his pride and struggle&mdash;his reserve and almost
abnormal sensitiveness. Then&mdash;the experience in the mountain!
How terribly deep that had sunk into Truedale&rsquo;s life; how
unable he had been to see in it any wrong but his own. Lynda had
always honoured him for that. It had made it possible for her to
trust him absolutely. She had respected his fine position and had
never blurred it by showing him how she, as a woman, could see the
erring on the woman&rsquo;s part. No, she had left Nella-Rose to
him as his high-minded chivalry had preserved her&mdash;she had
dared do all that because she felt so secure in the love and
sincerity of the present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bitterness was past. The shock had left her a bit weak and
helpless but she no longer thought of the human need of Betty. She
went home and sat down before the fire in the library and waited
for light. At ten o&rsquo;clock she came to a conclusion. Truedale
must decide this thing for himself! It was, after all, his great
opportunity. She could not, with honour and self-respect, throw
herself upon him and so complicate the misunderstanding. If her
life with him since June had not convinced him of her simple love
and faith&mdash;her words, now, could not. He must seek
her&mdash;must realize everything. And in this decision Lynda left
herself so stranded and desolate that she looked up with wet eyes
and saw&mdash;William Truedale&rsquo;s empty chair! A great longing
for her old friend rose in her breast&mdash;a longing that not even
death had taken from her. The clock struck the half-hour and Lynda
got up and with no faltering went toward the bedroom door behind
which the old man had started forth on his journey to find
peace.</p>
<p>And just as she went, with blinded eyes and aching heart, to
shut herself away from the dreariness of the present, Truedale
entered the house and, from the hall, watched her. He believed that
she had heard him enter, he hoped she was going to turn toward
him&mdash;but no! she went straight to the never-used room, shut
the door, and&mdash;locked it!</p>
<p>Truedale stood rooted to the spot. What he had hoped&mdash;what
trusted&mdash;he could hardly have told. But manlike he was the
true conservative and with the turning of that key his traditions
and established position crumbled around him.</p>
<p>Lynda and he were married and, unless they decided upon an open
break, they must live their lives. But the turning of the key
seemed to proclaim to the whole city a new dispensation. A
declaration of independence that spurned&mdash;tradition.</p>
<p>For a moment Truedale was angry, unsettled, and outraged. He
strode into the room with stern eyes; he walked half way to the
closed&mdash;and locked&mdash;door; he gazed upon it as if it were
a tangible foe which he might overcome and, by so doing,
re&euml;stablish the old ideals. Then&mdash;and it was the saving
grace&mdash;Truedale smiled grimly. &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; and turned to his room under the
eaves.</p>
<p>But the following day had to be faced. There were several things
that had to be dealt with besides the condition arising from the
locking of the door of William Truedale&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>Conning battled with this fact nearly all night, little
realizing that Lynda was feeling her way to the same conclusion in
the quiet room below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not beaten, Uncle William,&rdquo; she
whispered, kneeling beside the bed. &ldquo;If I could only see how
to meet to-morrow I would be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then a queer sort of comfort came to her. The humour with
which her old friend would have viewed the situation pervaded the
room, bringing strength with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she confided to the darkness in which the
old man seemed present, in a marvellously real way, &ldquo;I know I
love Conning. A make-believe love couldn&rsquo;t stand
this&mdash;but the true thing can. And he loves <i>me!</i> I know
it through and through. The other love of his
wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;what this is. But he must find this out for
himself. I&rsquo;ve always been close when he needed me; he must
come to me now&mdash;for his sake even more than for mine. I am
deserving of that, am I not, Uncle William?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The understanding friendship did not fail the girl kneeling by
the empty bed. It seemed to come through the rays of moonlight and
rest like a helpful touch upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little mother!&rdquo;&mdash;and in her soul Lynda
believed William Truedale and her mother had come
together&mdash;&ldquo;little mother, you did your best without
love; I will do mine&mdash;with it! And now I am going to bed and I
am going to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning Truedale and Lynda were both so precipitate
about attacking the situation that they nearly ran into each other
at the dining-room door. They both had the grace to laugh. Then
they talked of the work at hand for the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a studio to evolve,&rdquo; Lynda said, passing a
slice of toast to Truedale from the electric contrivance before
her, &ldquo;a woman wants a studio, she feels it will be an
inspiration. She&rsquo;s a nice little society woman who is bored
to death. She&rsquo;s written an article or two for a fashion paper
and she believes she has discovered herself. I wish I knew what to
put in the place. She&rsquo;d scorn the real thing and I hate to
compromise when it comes to such things. And you, Con, what have
you that must be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale looked at her earnestly. &ldquo;I must meet the lawyer
and McPherson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but may I come&mdash;for a
talk, Lyn, afterward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be in my workshop all day, Con, until dinner time
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day was a hard one for them both, but womanlike Lynda
accepted it and came to its close with less show of wear and tear
than did Truedale. She was restless and nervous. She worked
conscientiously until three and accomplished something in the
difficult task the society woman had entrusted her with; then she
went to her bedroom and, removing every sign of her craft, donned a
pretty house dress and went back to her shop. She meant to give
Truedale every legitimate assistance, but she was never prouder or
firmer in her life. She called the dogs and the cats in; she set
the small tea table by the hearth and lighted just fire enough to
take the chill from the room and yet leave it sweet and fresh.</p>
<p>At five there was a tap on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just in time, Con, for the tea,&rdquo; she called and
welcomed him in.</p>
<p>To find her so calm, cheerful, and lovely, was something of a
shock to Truedale. Had she been in tears, or, had she shown any
trace of the suffering he had endured, he would have taken her in
his arms and relegated the unfortunate money to the scrap-heap of
non-essentials. But the scene upon which he entered had the effect
of chilling him and bringing back the displeasing thought of
Lynda&rsquo;s sacrifice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had a hard day, Con?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink the tea, and&mdash;let me see, you like bread and
butter, don&rsquo;t you, instead of cakes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were silent for a moment while they sipped the hot tea.
Then, raising their eyes, they looked suddenly at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyn, I cannot do without you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She coloured deeply. She knew he did not mean to be
selfish&mdash;but he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would be willing even to&mdash;accept my
sacrifice?&rdquo; she asked so softly that he did not note the
yearning in the tones&mdash;the beseeching of him to abdicate the
position that, for her, was untenable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything&mdash;anything, Lynda. The day without you has
been&mdash;hell. We&rsquo;ll get rid of the money somehow. Now that
we both know how little it means, we&rsquo;ll begin again
and&mdash;free from Uncle William&rsquo;s wrong
conceptions&mdash;Lyn&mdash;&rdquo; He put his cup down and rose
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she whispered, shrinking back into her low
armchair and holding him off by her smile of detachment more than
by her word of command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I cannot face life without you,&rdquo; Truedale
spoke hoarsely, &ldquo;I never really had to contemplate it before.
I need you&mdash;must have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came a step nearer, but Lynda shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something has happened to us, Con. Something rather
tremendous. We must not bungle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing looms high. Only one, Lyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many things do, Con. They have been crowding thick around
me all day. There are worse things than losing each
other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Truedale denied, vehemently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We could lose ourselves! This thing that makes you
fling aside what went before, this thing that makes me
long&mdash;oh! how I long, Con&mdash;to come to you and forget,
this thing&mdash;what is it? It is the holiest thing we know, and
unless we guard it sacredly we shall hurt and kill it and then, by
and by, Con, we shall look at each other with frightened
eyes&mdash;over a dead, dead love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lynda, how&mdash;can you? How dare you say these things
when you confess&mdash;Oh! my&mdash;wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&rdquo;&mdash;and she seemed withdrawing from
Truedale as he advanced&mdash;&ldquo;because I have confessed! You
and I, Con, have reached to-day, by different routes, the most
important and vital problem. All my life I have been pushing doors
open as I came along. Sometimes I have only peered in and hurried
on; sometimes I have stayed and learned a lesson. It will always be
so with me. I must know. I think you are willing not to know unless
you are forced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale winced and went back slowly to his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Con, dear, unless you wish it otherwise, I want, as far
as possible, to begin from to-day and find out just how much we do
mean to each other. Let us push open the doors ahead until we make
sure we both want the same abiding place. Should you find a spot
better, safer for you than this that we thought we knew, I will
never hold you by a look or word, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;Lyn?&rdquo; Truedale&rsquo;s voice
shook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For myself I ask the same privilege.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that we&mdash;live together, yet
apart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you will it otherwise, dear. In that case, we will
close this door and say&mdash;good-bye, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her strength, her tenderness, unmanned Truedale. Again he felt
that call upon him which she had inspired the night of his
confession. Again he rallied to defend her&mdash;from her own
pitiless sense of honour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heaven!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It shall not be
good-bye. I will accept your terms, live up to them, and dare the
future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, old Con! And now, please, dear, go. I think&mdash;I
think I am going to cry&mdash;a little and&rdquo;&mdash;she looked
up quiveringly&mdash;&ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t have red eyes at dinner
time. Brace and Betty are coming. Thank heaven, Con, Betty will
make us laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p>Having agreed upon this period of probation both Lynda and
Truedale entered upon it with characteristic determination. There
were times when Conning dejectedly believed that no woman could act
as Lynda was doing, if she loved a man. No, it was not in
woman&rsquo;s power to forego all Lynda was foregoing if she loved
deeply. Not that Lynda could be said to be cold or indifferent; she
had never been sweeter, truer; but she was so amazingly serene!</p>
<p>Perhaps she was content, having secured his rights for him, to
go on and be thankful that so little was actually exacted from
her.</p>
<p>But such reasoning eventually shamed Truedale, and he
acknowledged that there was something superb in a woman who, while
still loving a man, was able to withhold herself from him until
both he and she had sounded the depths of their natures.</p>
<p>In this state of mind Truedale devoted himself to business, and
Lynda, with a fresh power that surprised even herself, resumed her
own tasks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is <i>love</i>,&rdquo; she often thought to
herself, &ldquo;it is the real thing. Some women think they have
love when <i>love has them</i>. This beautiful, tangible something
that is making even these days sacred has proved itself. I can rely
upon it&mdash;lean heavily upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes she wondered what she was waiting for. Often she
feared, in her sad moments, that it might last forever&mdash;be
accepted this poor counterfeit for the real&mdash;and the full
glory escape her and Truedale.</p>
<p>But at her best she knew what she was waiting for&mdash;what was
coming. It was something that, driving all else away, would carry
her and Conning together without reservations or doubts. They would
<i>know!</i> He would know the master passion of his life; she,
that she could count all lost unless she made his life complete and
so crown her own.</p>
<p>The money was never mentioned. In good and safe investments it
lay, awaiting a day, so Truedale told McPherson, when it could be
got rid of without dishonour or disgrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, good heavens! haven&rsquo;t you any personal
ambitions&mdash;you and Lynda?&rdquo; McPherson had learned to
admire Conning, and Lynda had always been one of his private
inspirations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None that Lynda and I cannot supply ourselves,&rdquo;
Truedale replied. &ldquo;To have our work, and the necessity for
our work, taken from us would be no advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t you a duty to the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have, and I&rsquo;m trying to find out just what
it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And living this strange, abnormal life&mdash;often wondering
why, and fearing much&mdash;three, then four years, passed them
by.</p>
<p>It is one thing for two proud, sensitive natures to enter upon a
deliberate course, and quite another for them to abandon it when
the supposed need is past. There was now no doubt in
Truedale&rsquo;s heart concerning Lynda&rsquo;s motive for marrying
him; nor did Lynda for one moment question Truedale&rsquo;s deep
affection for her. Yet they waited&mdash;quite subconsciously at
first, then with tragic stubbornness&mdash;for something to sweep
obstacles aside without either surrendering his position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must want me so that nothing can sway him
again,&rdquo; thought Lynda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must know that my love for her can endure
anything&mdash;even this!&rdquo; argued Conning, and his stand was
better taken than hers as she was to find out one day.</p>
<p>It seemed enough, in the beginning, to live their lives close
and confidentially&mdash;to feel the tie of dependence that held
them; but the knot cut in deep at times and they suffered in
foolish but proud silence.</p>
<p>Many things occurred during those years that widened the horizon
for them all. Betty&rsquo;s first child came and went, almost
taking the life of the young mother with it. Before the possible
calamity Brace stood appalled, and both Conning and Lynda realized
how true a note the girl was in their lives. She seemed to belong
to them in a sense stronger than blood could have made her. They
could not imagine life without her sunny companionship. Never were
they to forget the grim dreariness of the once cheerful apartment
during those days and nights when Death hovered near, weighing the
chances. But Betty recovered and came back with a yearning look in
her eyes that had never been there before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she confided to Lynda, &ldquo;there will
always be moments when I must listen to hear if my baby is calling.
At times, Lyn, it seems as if he were just on ahead&mdash;keeping
me from forgetting. It doesn&rsquo;t make me sad, dear, it&rsquo;s
really beautiful that he didn&rsquo;t quite escape me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you go to The Refuge to think and look and
listen?&rdquo; Lynda asked. For they all worried now when Betty
betook herself to the little house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; And here Betty twinkled. &ldquo;I go
there to meet Betty Arnold face to face, and ask her if she would
rather trade back. And then I come trotting home, almost out of
breath, to precious old Brace; I&rsquo;m so afraid he won&rsquo;t
know he&rsquo;s still the one big thing in the world for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This little child of Betty&rsquo;s and Brace&rsquo;s had made a
deep impression upon them all. It had lived only three days and
while it stayed the black shadow hanging over the mother had made
the baby seem of less account; but later, they all recalled the
pretty, soft mite with the strange, old look in its wide eyes. He
had been beautiful as babies who are not going to stay often are.
There were to be no years for him to change and grow and so
loveliness came with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon the little chap thought we didn&rsquo;t want
him,&rdquo; Brace choked as he spoke over the small, cold body of
his first-born, &ldquo;so he turned back home before he forgot the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, brother!&rdquo; Lynda pleaded as she stood
with Truedale beside him. &ldquo;You know the way home might have
been longer and harder, by and by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Betty and I might have helped to make it easier;
for a time, anyway.&rdquo; The eternal revolt against seemingly
useless suffering rang in the words.</p>
<p>And that night Truedale had kissed Lynda lingeringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such things,&rdquo; he said, referring to the day&rsquo;s
sad duties, &ldquo;such things do drag people together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that something new throbbed in their lives&mdash;something
that had not held sway before. If Betty looked and listened for the
little creature who had gone on ahead, Lynda listened and looked
into what had been a void in her life before.</p>
<p>She had always loved children in a kindly, detached way, but she
had never appropriated them. But now she could not forget the
feeling of that small, downy head that for a day or so nestled on
her breast while the young mother&rsquo;s feet all but slipped over
the brink. She remembered the strange look in the child&rsquo;s
deep eyes the night it died. The lonely, aged look that, in
passing, seemed trying to fix one familiar object. And when the dim
light went out in the little face and only a dead baby lay in her
arms, maternity had been called forth from its slumber and in
following Betty&rsquo;s child, became vitalized and definite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think I shall adopt a child.&rdquo; So she had
thought while the cold little head yet lay in the hollow of her
arm. She never let go this thought and only hesitated before
voicing it to Truedale because she feared he could not understand
and might cruelly misunderstand. Life was hard enough and difficult
enough for them both just then, and often, coming into the quiet
home at the day&rsquo;s end, Lynda would say, to cheer her faint
heart:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it&rsquo;s really like coming to a hearth upon
which the fire is not yet kindled. But, thank heaven! it is a clean
hearth, not cluttered with ashes&mdash;it is ready for the
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But was it? More and more as the time went on and Truedale kept
his faith and walked his way near hers&mdash;oh! they were thankful
for that&mdash;but still apart, Lynda wondered. It was all so
futile, so utterly selfish and childish&mdash;yet neither spoke.
Then suddenly came the big thing that drove them together and swept
aside all the barrier of rubbish they had erected. Like many great
and portentous things it seemed very like the still, small voice in
the burning bush&mdash;the tiny star in the black night.</p>
<p>Truedale had had an enlightening conversation with McPherson in
the afternoon. The old doctor was really a soft-hearted
sentimentalist and occasionally he laid himself bare to the eye of
some trustworthy friend. This time it was Truedale.</p>
<p>Up and down the plain, businesslike office McPherson was
tramping when Conning was announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! come in, come in!&rdquo; called McPherson. &ldquo;You
can better understand this than some. I&rsquo;ve had a devil of a
day. One confounded thing after another to take the soul out of me.
And now this letter from old Jim White!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conning started. It had now been years since Pine Cone had
touched his thought sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with White?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out of the window!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale did so, and into the wall-like snow which had been
falling all day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been having that in the mountains for
weeks. Trails blotted out, folk hiding like beasts, and that good
old chap, White, took this time to break his leg. There he lay for
a whole week, damn it all! Two of his dogs died&mdash;he, himself,
almost starved. Managed to crawl to the food while there was any,
and then some one ploughed through to get Jim to organize a hanging
or some other trifling thing, and found him! Good Lord, Truedale,
what they need down there is roads! roads! Roads over which folk
can travel to one another and become human. That&rsquo;s all the
world needs anyway!&rdquo; Here McPherson stopped in front of
Truedale and glared as if about to put the blame of impeded traffic
up to him. &ldquo;Roads over which folk can travel to one another.
See here, you&rsquo;re looking for some excuse to get rid of your
damned money. Why don&rsquo;t you build roads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roads?&rdquo; Truedale did not know whether to laugh or
take his man seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, roads. I&rsquo;m going down to Jim. I haven&rsquo;t
much money; I&rsquo;ve made a good deal, but somehow I never seem
able to be caught with the goods on me. But what little I&rsquo;ve
got now goes to Jim for the purpose of forging a connecting link
between him and the Centre. But here&rsquo;s a job for you. You can
grasp this need. I&rsquo;ve got a boy in the hospital; he caved in
from over-study. Trying to get an education while starving himself
to death and doing without underclothes. You ought to know how to
hew a short cut to him, Truedale; you did some hacking through
underbrush yourself. If I didn&rsquo;t believe folk would travel to
one another over roads, if there <i>were</i> roads, I&rsquo;d go
out and cut my throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big man, troubled and as full of sympathy as a tender woman,
paused in his strides and ejaculated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it all, Truedale!&rdquo; Had he been a woman he
would have dissolved in tears.</p>
<p>Truedale at last caught his meaning. Here was a possible chance
to set the accumulating money free. For two hours, while the sun
travelled down to the west, the men talked over plans and
projects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll look after the boy in the hospital,
Dr. McPherson. I know the short cut to him and he probably can lead
me to others, but I want&rdquo;&mdash;and here Truedale&rsquo;s
eyes grew gloomy&mdash;&ldquo;I want you to take with you down to
Pine Cone some checks signed in blank. I know the need of roads
down there,&rdquo; did he not? and for an instant his brows grew
furrowed as he reflected how different his own life might have
been, had travelling been easy, back in the time when he was at the
mercy of the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to do something for Pine Cone. Make the
roads, of course, but back up those men and women who are doing
God&rsquo;s work down there with little help or money. They know
the people&mdash;Jim has explained them to me. They&rsquo;re not
&lsquo;extry polite,&rsquo; Jim says, but they understand the
needs. I don&rsquo;t care to have my name known&mdash;I&rsquo;m
rather poor stuff for a philanthropist&mdash;but I want to do
something as a starter, and this seems an inspiration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McPherson had been listening, and gradually his long strides
became less nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until to-day, I haven&rsquo;t wished your uncle back,
Truedale, since he went. He was a poor, inarticulate fellow, but
I&rsquo;ve learned to realize that he had a wide vision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Dr. McPherson, but I have often wished him
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once outside McPherson&rsquo;s house, Truedale raised his head
and sniffed the clear, winter air with keen enjoyment. A sense of
achievement possessed him; the joy of feeling he had solved a
knotty problem. He found he could think of Pine Cone&mdash;and,
yes, of Nella-Rose&mdash;without a hurting smart. He was going to
do something for her&mdash;for her people! He was going to make
life easier&mdash;happier&mdash;for them, so he prayed in his
silent, wordless way. He had a new and strange impulse to go to
Lynda and tell her that at last he was released from any hold of
the past. He was going to do what he could and there was no longer
any dragging of the anchors. He wanted her to help him&mdash;to
work out some questions from the woman&rsquo;s point of view. So he
hurried on and entered the house with a light, boyish step.</p>
<p>Thomas, bent but stately, was laying the table in the cheerful
dining room. There were flowers in a deep green bowl, pale golden
asters.</p>
<p>Long afterward Truedale recalled everything as if it had been
burned in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Lynda in?&rdquo; he asked, for they all clung to
the titles of the old days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, Mister Con. She went out in a deal of a hurry
long about three o&rsquo;clock. She didn&rsquo;t say a
word&mdash;and that&rsquo;s agin her pleasant fashion&mdash;so I
took it that she had business that fretted her. She&rsquo;s been in
the workshop all day.&rdquo; Thomas put the plates in place. They
were white china, with delicate gold edges. &ldquo;Hum! hum! Mister
Con, your uncle used to say, when he felt talkative, that Miss
Lynda ought to have some one to hold her back when she took to
running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look her up, Thomas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conning went up to the workshop and turned on the electricity. A
desolate sensation overcame the exhilaration of the afternoon.
Lynda seemed strangely, ominously distant&mdash;as if she had gone
upon a long, long journey.</p>
<p>There was a dying fire on the hearth and the room was in order
except for the wide table upon which still lay the work Lynda had
been engaged with before she left the house.</p>
<p>Truedale sat down before it and gradually became absorbed, while
not really taking in the meaning of what he saw. He had often
studied and appreciated Lynda&rsquo;s original way of solving her
problems. It was not enough for her to place upon paper the designs
her trained talent evolved; she always, as she put it, lived in the
rooms she conceived. Here were real furniture&mdash;diminutive, but
perfect, and real hangings&mdash;colour and form ideal, and
arranged so that they could be shifted in order that light effects
might be tested.</p>
<p>It was no wonder Truedale had often remarked that Lynda&rsquo;s
work was so individual and personal&mdash;she breathed the breath
of life in it before she let it go from her. Truedale had always
been thankful that marriage had not taken from Lynda her joy in her
profession. He would have hated to know that he interfered with so
real and vital a gift.</p>
<p>But this room upon which he was now looking was different from
anything he had ever before seen in the workshop. It interested and
puzzled him.</p>
<p>Lynda&rsquo;s specialties were libraries and living rooms; there
were two or three things she never attempted&mdash;and this?
Truedale looked closer. How pretty it was&mdash;like a
child&rsquo;s playroom&mdash;and how fanciful! There was a
fireplace off in a corner, before which stood a screen with a most
benign goblin warning away, with spread claws, any heedless,
toddling feet. The broad window-seats might serve as boxes for
childish treasure. There were delectable, wee chairs and
conveniently low stools; there was a tiny bed set in a dim corner
over which, on a protecting shield, angels with folded wings and
rapt faces were outlined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this must be a&mdash;nursery!&rdquo; Truedale
exclaimed half aloud; &ldquo;and she said she would never design
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clearly he recalled Lynda&rsquo;s reason. &ldquo;If a father and
a mother cannot conceive and carry out the needs of a nursery, they
do not deserve one. I could never bring myself to intrude
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; Truedale bent closer. The
table had been painted white to serve as a floor for the dainty
setting, and now, as he looked he saw stains&mdash;dark, tell-tale
stains on the shining surface.</p>
<p>They were tear-stains; Lynda, who so joyously put her heart and
soul in the ideals for other homes, had wept over the nursery of
another woman&rsquo;s child!</p>
<p>For some reason Truedale was that day particularly open to
impression. As he sat with the toy-like emblems before him, the
holiest and strongest things of life seized upon him with terrific
meaning. He drew out his watch and saw that it was the dinner hour
and the still house proved that the mistress was yet absent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one person to whom she would go,&rdquo; he
murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to Betty&rsquo;s and bring Lynda
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made an explanation to Thomas that covered the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found what the trouble was, Thomas,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It will be all right when we get back. But don&rsquo;t keep
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a cab to Brace&rsquo;s. He was too distraught to put
himself on exhibition in a public conveyance. Brace sat in lonely
but apparently contented state at the head of his table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you, old man,&rdquo; he greeted. &ldquo;You
were never more welcome. I&rsquo;ll have a plate put on for you at
once. What&rsquo;s the matter? You look&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ken, where&rsquo;s Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run away to herself, Con. Went yesterday. Goes less and
less often, but she cut yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has&mdash;has Lynda been here to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. About three. When she found Betty gone, she
wouldn&rsquo;t stay. Sit down, old man. You&rsquo;ll learn, as I
have, to appreciate Lyn more if she isn&rsquo;t always where we men
have thought women ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale sat down opposite Kendall but said he would take only a
cup of coffee. When it was finished he rose, more steadily, and
said quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s unwritten law, Ken, that we
shouldn&rsquo;t follow Betty up without an invitation; but
I&rsquo;ve got to go over there to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous, old man. I advise against it.
What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see Lyn. I believe she is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a large-sized misunderstanding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, Ken, God helping me, it&rsquo;s going to be the
biggest <i>understanding</i> Lynda and I have ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kendall was impressed&mdash;and, consequently, silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Betty will forgive me.
Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, old chap, and&mdash;and whatever it is, I
fancy it will come out all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, into the night Truedale plunged&mdash;determined to
master the absurd situation that both he and Lynda had permitted to
exist. He felt like a man who had been suffering in a nightmare and
had just awakened and shaken off the effect of the unholy
dream.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p>Lynda, that winter day, had undertaken her task with unwonted
energy. She had never done a similar piece of work before. In her
early beginning she had rather despised the inadequacy of women
who, no matter what might be said in defense of their ignorance
regarding the rest of their homes, did not know how to design and
plan their own nurseries. Later she had eliminated designing of
this kind because so few asked for it, and it did not pay to put
much time on study in preparation for the rare occasions when
nurseries were included in the orders. But this was an exception. A
woman who had lost three children was expecting the fourth, and she
had come to Lynda with a touching appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You helped make a home of my house, Mrs. Truedale, but I
always managed the nursery&mdash;myself before; now I cannot. I
want you to put joy and welcome in it for me. If I were to
undertake it I should fail miserably, and evolve only gloom and
fear. It will be different&mdash;afterward. But you understand
and&mdash;you will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda had understood and had set herself to her work with the
new, happy insight that Betty&rsquo;s little baby had made
possible. It had all gone well until the &ldquo;sleeping
corner&rdquo; was reached, and then&mdash;something happened. A
memory of one of Betty&rsquo;s confessions started it.
&ldquo;Lyn,&rdquo; she had said, just before her baby came,
&ldquo;I kneel by this small, waiting crib and pray&mdash;as only
mothers know how to pray&mdash;and God teaches them afresh every
time! I do so want to be worthy of the confidence
of&mdash;God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&mdash;am never to know!&rdquo; Lynda bowed her
head. &ldquo;I with my love&mdash;with my desire to hear God
speak&mdash;am never to hear. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it was that Lynda wept. Wept first from a desolate sense of
defeat; then&mdash;and God sometimes speaks to women kneeling
beside the beds of children not their own&mdash;she raised her head
and trembled at the flood of joy that overcame her. It was like a
mirage, seen in another woman&rsquo;s world, of her own blessed
heritage.</p>
<p>Filled with this vision she had fled to Betty&rsquo;s, only to
find that Betty had fled on her own account!</p>
<p>There was no moment of indecision; welcome or not, Lynda had to
reach Betty&mdash;and at once!</p>
<p>She had tarried, after setting her face to the river. She even
stopped at a quiet little tea room and ate a light meal. Then she
waited until the throng of business men had crossed the ferry to
their homes. It was quite dark when she reached the wooded spot
where, hidden deep among the trees, was Betty&rsquo;s retreat.</p>
<p>There was a light in the house&mdash;the living room faced the
path&mdash;and through the uncurtained window Lynda saw Betty
sitting before the fire with her little dog upon her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Betty,&rdquo; she whispered, stretching her arms out
to the lonely little figure in the low, deep chair. &ldquo;Betty!
Betty!&rdquo; She waited a moment, then she tapped lightly upon the
glass. The dog sprang to the floor, its sharp ears twitching, but
he did not bark. Betty came to the door and stood in the warm,
lighted space with arms extended. She knew no fear, there was only
doubt upon her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyn, is it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! How did you guess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All day I&rsquo;ve been thinking about you&mdash;wanting
you. Sometimes I can bring people that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have wanted you! Betty, may I
stay&mdash;to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, dear. Stay until you want to go home.
I&rsquo;ve been pulling myself together; I&rsquo;m almost ready to
go back to Brace. Come in! Why&mdash;what is it, dear? Come, let me
take off your things! There! Now lie back in the chair and tell
Betty all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! Betty, I want to sit so&mdash;at your feet. I
want to learn all that you can teach me. You have never had your
eyes blinded&mdash;or you would know how the light
hurts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then. Put your blessed, tired head on my knee.
You&rsquo;re my little girl to-night, Lyn, and I am
your&mdash;mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Lynda cried as a child might who had reached safety
at last. Betty did not check or soothe the heavy sobs&mdash;she
waited. She knew Lynda was saved from whatever had troubled her. It
was only the telling of it now. And presently the dark head was
lifted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty, it is Con and I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve loved him all my life; and I believe&mdash;I
<i>know</i>&mdash;he loved me! Women do not make mistakes about the
real thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, Lyn, never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty, once when I thought Con had wronged me, I wanted
to come to you&mdash;I almost did&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t then!
Now that I am sure I have wronged him, it is easy to come to
you&mdash;you are so understanding!&rdquo; The radiance of
Lynda&rsquo;s face rather startled Betty. Abandon, relief,
glorified it until it seemed a new&mdash;a far more beautiful
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my life, Betty, I&rsquo;ve been controlling
myself&mdash;conquering myself. I got started that way
and&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve kept on. I&rsquo;ve never done anything
without considering and weighing; but now I&rsquo;m going to fling
myself into love and life and&mdash;pay whatever there is to
pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Lyn, dear, please go slower.&rdquo; Betty pressed
her face to the head at her knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty, there was another love in Con&rsquo;s
life&mdash;one that should never have been there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This almost took Betty&rsquo;s breath. She was thankful
Lynda&rsquo;s eyes were turned away; but by some strange magic the
words raised Truedale in Betty&rsquo;s very human imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sometimes think the&mdash;the thing that
happened&mdash;was the working out of an old inheritance; Con has
overcome much, but that caught him in its snare. He was ready to
let it ruin his whole future. He would never have
flinched&mdash;never have known, or admitted if he had
known&mdash;what he had foregone. But the thing was taken out of
his control altogether&mdash;the girl married another man!</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Con came to himself again, he told me,
Betty&mdash;told me so simply, so tragically, that I saw what a
deep cut the experience had made in his life&mdash;how it had
humbled him. Never once did he blame any one else. I loved him for
the way he looked upon it; so many men could not have done so. That
made the difference with me. It was what the thing had done to Con
that made it possible for me to love him the more!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wanted the best things in life but didn&rsquo;t think
he was worthy! And I? Well, I thought I saw enough for us both, and
so I married him! Then something happened&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t
matter what it was&mdash;it was a foolish, ugly thing, but it had
to be something. And Con thought I had never forgiven the&mdash;the
first love&mdash;that I had sacrificed myself for him&mdash;in
marriage! And no woman could bear that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor, dear Lyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see, Betty, it all comes from the idiotic
idea that men&mdash;some men&mdash;have about women. They put us on
a toppling pedestal; when we fall they are surprised, and when we
don&rsquo;t they&mdash;are afraid of us! And all the time&mdash;you
know this, Betty&mdash;we ought not to be on pedestals at all; we
don&rsquo;t&mdash;we <i>don&rsquo;t</i> belong on them! We want to
be close and go along together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Lyn; we do! we do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;after Con misunderstood, I just let him go
along thinking I was&mdash;well, the kind of woman who could
sacrifice herself. I thought he would want me so that he
would&mdash;find out. And so we&rsquo;ve been eating our hearts
out&mdash;for ages!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Lyn! you cruel, foolish girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and because I knew you would say that&mdash;I
could come to you. You&mdash;do not blame Con?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blame <i>him</i>! Why, Lyn, a gentleman doesn&rsquo;t
take a woman off her beastly pedestal; she comes down
herself&mdash;if she isn&rsquo;t a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Betty, I&rsquo;m down! I&rsquo;m down, and
I&rsquo;m going to crawl to Con, if necessary, and then&mdash;I
think he&rsquo;ll lift me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never pull you down, that&rsquo;s one sure
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! thank you, Betty. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Lyn&mdash;what has so suddenly brought you to your
senses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your little baby, Betty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My&mdash;baby!&rdquo; The words came in a hard, gasping
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I held him when he died, Betty. I had never been close to
a baby before&mdash;never! A strange thing happened to me as I
looked at him. It was like knowing what a flower would be while
holding only the bud. The baby&rsquo;s eyes had the same expression
I have seen in Con&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;in Brace&rsquo;s; I know now
it is the whole world&rsquo;s look. It was full of
wonder&mdash;full of questions as to what it all meant. I am sure
that it comes and goes but never really is answered&mdash;here,
Betty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Lyn. And I have been
bitter&mdash;miserable&mdash;because I felt that it wasn&rsquo;t
fair to take my baby until he had done some little work in the
world! And now&mdash;why, he did a great thing. My little, little
baby!&rdquo; Betty was clinging to Lynda, crying as if all the
agony were swept away forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes&rdquo;&mdash;Lynda pressed against
Betty&mdash;&ldquo;sometimes, lately, in Con&rsquo;s eyes I have
seen the look! It was as if he were asking me whether he had yet
been punished enough! And I&rsquo;ve been thinking of
myself&mdash;thinking what Con owed <i>me;</i> what <i>I</i>
wanted; <i>when</i> I should have it! I hate and despise myself for
my littleness and prudery; why, he&rsquo;s a thousand times finer
than I! That&rsquo;s what pedestals have done for women. But now,
Betty, I&rsquo;m down; and I&rsquo;m down to stay.
I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Lyn, dear.&rdquo; Betty mopped her wet face and
started up. She had seen a tall form pass the window, and she felt
as if something tremendous were at stake. &ldquo;Just a minute,
Lyn. I must speak to Mrs. Waters if you are to stay over night.
She&rsquo;s old, you know, and goes early to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda still sat on the floor&mdash;her face turned to the red
glow of the fire that was growing duller and duller. Presently the
door opened, and her words flowed on as if there had been no
interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Con to-morrow. I had to make
sure&mdash;first; but I know now, I know! I&rsquo;m going to tell
him all about it&mdash;and ask him to let me walk beside him.
I&rsquo;m going to tell him how lonely I&rsquo;ve been in the place
he put me&mdash;how I&rsquo;ve hated it! And some time&mdash;I feel
as sure as sure can be&mdash;there will be something I can do that
will prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My&mdash;darling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arms stronger than Betty&rsquo;s held her close&mdash;held her
with a very human, understanding strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done the one big thing, Lyn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, not yet, Con, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have made me realize what a wrong&mdash;a bitter
wrong&mdash;I did you, when I thought you could be less than a
loving woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Con! And have you been lonely, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet, I should have died of loneliness had something not
told me I was still travelling up toward you. That has made it
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead&rdquo;&mdash;Lynda drew his face down to
hers&mdash;&ldquo;instead, I&rsquo;ve been struggling up toward
<i>you!</i>! Dear, dear Con, it isn&rsquo;t men and women;
it&rsquo;s <i>the</i> man&mdash;<i>the</i> woman. Can&rsquo;t you
see? It&rsquo;s the sort of thing life makes of us that counts; not
the steps we take on the way. You&mdash;you know this,
Con?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, now, from the bottom of my soul.&rdquo;</p>
<hr style="width: 45%" />
<p>It was one of Betty&rsquo;s quaint sayings that some lives were
guided by flashlights, others by a steady gleam. Hers had always
been by the former method. She made her passage from one
illumination to another with great faith, high courage, and much
joyousness. After the night when Lynda made her see what her dear,
dead baby had accomplished in his brief stay, she rose triumphant
from her sorrow. She was her old, bright self again; she sang in
her home, transfigured Brace by her happiness, and undertook her
old interests and duties with genuine delight.</p>
<p>But for Lynda and Truedale the steady gleam was necessary. They
never questioned&mdash;never doubted&mdash;after the night when
they came home from the little house in the woods. To them both
happiness was no new thing; it was a precious old thing given back
after a dark period of testing. The days were all too short, and
when night brought Conning running and whistling to the door, Lynda
smiled and realized that at last the fire was burning briskly on
her nice, clean hearth. They had so much in common&mdash;so much
that demanded them both in the doing of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No bridges for us, here and there, over which to reach
each other,&rdquo; thought Lynda; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the one path
for us both.&rdquo; Then her eyes grew tenderly brooding as she
remembered how &rsquo;twas a little child that had led
them&mdash;not theirs, but another&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The business involved in setting old William Truedale&rsquo;s
money in circulation was absorbing Conning at this time. Once he
set his feet upon the way, he did not intend to turn back; but he
sometimes wondered if the day would ever come when he could, with a
clear conscience, feel poor enough to enjoy himself, selfishly,
once more.</p>
<p>From McPherson he heard constantly of the work in the southern
hills. Truedale was, indeed, a strong if silent and unsuspected
force there. As once he had been an unknown quantity, so he
remained; but the work went on, supervised by Jim White, who used
with sagacity and cleverness the power placed in his hands.</p>
<p>Truedale&rsquo;s own particular interests were nearly all
educational. Even here, he held himself in reserve&mdash;placed in
more competent hands the power they could wield better than he.
Still, he was personally known and gratefully regarded by many
young men and women who were struggling&mdash;as he once had
struggled&mdash;for what to them was dearer than all else. He
always contrived to leave them their independence and self-respect.
Naturally all this was gratifying and vital to Lynda. Achievement
was dear to her temperament, and the successes of others,
especially those nearest to her, were more precious to her than her
own. She saw Truedale drop his old hesitating, bewildered manner
like a discarded mantle. She grew to rely upon his calm strength
that developed with the demands made upon it. She approved of him
so! And that realization brought out the best in her.</p>
<p>One November evening she and Con were sitting in the library,
Truedale at his desk, Lynda idly and luxuriously rocking to and
fro, her hands clasped over her head. She had learned, at last, the
joy of absolute relaxation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big snow-storm setting in,&rdquo; she
said, smiling softly. Then, apropos of nothing: &ldquo;Con,
we&rsquo;ve been married four years and over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that, Lyn? It seems to me like my whole
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Con&mdash;so long as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessedly long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After another pause Lynda spoke merrily: &ldquo;Con, I want some
of Uncle William&rsquo;s money. A lot of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale tossed her a new check book. &ldquo;Now that you see
there is no string tied to it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;may I ask
what for? Just sympathetic interest, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Well, it&rsquo;s this way. Betty and I are
broke. It&rsquo;s fine for you to make roads and build schools and
equip the youth of America for getting all the learning they can
carry, but Betty and I are after the babies. We&rsquo;ve been
agonizing over the Saxe Home&mdash;Betty&rsquo;s on the
Board&mdash;and before Christmas we are going to undress all those
poor standardized infants and start their cropped hair to
growing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale laughed heartily. &ldquo;Intimacy with Betty,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;has coloured your descriptive powers, Lyn,
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all happy women talk one tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you <i>are</i> happy, Lyn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy? Yes&mdash;happy, Con!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They smiled at each other across the broad table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty has told the superintendent that if there is a blue
stripe or a cropped head on December twenty-fourth, she&rsquo;s
going to recommend the dismissal of the present staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord! Does any one ever take Betty seriously? I
should think one of those board meetings would bear a strong family
resemblance to an afternoon tea&mdash;rather a frivolous
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t. And, honestly, people are tremendously
afraid of Betty. She makes them laugh, but they know she gets what
she wants&mdash;and with a joke she drives her truths
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in that.&rdquo; Truedale looked
earnest. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a great Betty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s up to Betty and me, now,&rdquo; Lynda went
on. &ldquo;We can take off the shabby, faded little duds, but
we&rsquo;ve got to have something to put on at once, or the kiddies
will take cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think that to start a child out in stripes is almost
as bad as finishing him in them. To make a child
feel&mdash;different&mdash;is sure to damn him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you are going to make the Saxe Home an example and
set the ball rolling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Con. And we&rsquo;re going to slam the door in
the faces of the dramatic rich this Christmas. The lambies at the
Saxe are going to have a nice, old-fashioned tree. They are going
to dress it themselves the night before, and whisper up the chimney
what they want&mdash;and there is not going to be a speech on
Christmas Day within a mile of that Home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. I&rsquo;d like to come in on that
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can, Con, we&rsquo;ll need you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas always does set the children in one&rsquo;s
thoughts, doesn&rsquo;t it? I suppose Betty is particularly
keen&mdash;having had her baby for a day or so.&rdquo;
Truedale&rsquo;s eyes were tender. Betty&rsquo;s baby and its
fulfilled mission were sacred to him and Lynda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty is going to adopt a child, Con.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She says she cannot stand Christmas without one.
It&rsquo;s a rebuke to&mdash;to her boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little Bet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it makes me so&mdash;so humble when I see her
courage. She says if she has a dozen children of her own it will
make no difference; she must have her first child&rsquo;s
representative. She&rsquo;s about decided upon the
one&mdash;he&rsquo;s the most awful of them all. She&rsquo;s only
hesitating to see if anything awfuller will turn up. She says
she&rsquo;s going to take a baby no one else will
have&mdash;she&rsquo;s going to do the biggest thing she can for
her own dead boy. As if her baby ever could be dead! Sometimes I
think he is more alive than if he had stayed here and got all
snarled up in earthly things&mdash;as so many do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conning came close to Lynda and drew her head back against his
breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are&mdash;crying, darling!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s Betty. Con, what is it about
her that sort of brightens the way for us all, yet dims our
eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very illuminating. It&rsquo;s a big
thing&mdash;this of adopting a child. What does Brace think of
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He adores everything Betty does. He
says&rdquo;&mdash;Lynda smiled up into the face above
her&mdash;&ldquo;he says he wishes Betty had chosen one with hair a
little less crimson, but that doubtless he&rsquo;ll grow to like
that tint better than any other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyn, have you ever thought of adopting a
child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;sometimes. Yes, Con.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you ever feel that you ought&mdash;that you want
to&mdash;I will be glad to&mdash;to help you. I see the
risk&mdash;the chance, and I think I would like a handsome one. But
it is Christmas time, and a man and woman, if they have their
hearts in the right places, do think of children and trees and all
the rest at this season. Still&rdquo;&mdash;and with that Truedale
pressed his lips to Lynda&rsquo;s hair&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
selfish, you seem already to fill every chink of my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Con, that&rsquo;s a blessed thing to say to a
woman&mdash;even though the woman knows you ought not to say it.
And now, I&rsquo;m going to tell you something else, Con.
It&rsquo;s foolish and trifling, perhaps, but I&rsquo;ve set my
heart upon it ever since the Saxe Home got me to
thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything in the world, Lyn! Can I help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say you could. You&rsquo;ll have to be about the
whole of it. Starting this Christmas, I&rsquo;m going to have a
tree&mdash;right here in this room&mdash;close to Uncle
William&rsquo;s chair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! and for&mdash;for whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Con, how unimaginative you are! For you, for me, for
Uncle William, for any one&mdash;any really right person, young or
old&mdash;who needs a Christmas tree. Somehow, I have a rigid
belief that some one will always be waiting. It may not be an
empty-handed baby. Perhaps you and I may have to care for some dear
<i>old</i> soul that others have forgotten. We could do this for
Uncle William, couldn&rsquo;t we, Con?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children cannot always know what they are missing,
but the old can, and my heart aches for them often&mdash;aches
until it really hurts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are so alike, Con, the babies and the very aged.
They need the same things&mdash;the coddling, the play, the pretty
toys to amuse them&mdash;until they fall asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lynda, you are all nerves and fancies. Pretty
ones&mdash;but dangerous. We&rsquo;ll have our
tree&mdash;we&rsquo;ll call it Uncle William&rsquo;s. We&rsquo;ll
take any one&mdash;every one who is sent to us&mdash;and be
grateful. And that makes me think, we must have a particularly
giddy celebration up at the Sanatorium. McPherson and I were
speaking of it to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Con, I wonder how many secret interests you have of which
I do not know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale laughed, a bit embarrassed. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he
said, suddenly changing the subject, &ldquo;talking about nerves
reminds me that when the holidays are over you and I are going away
on a honeymoon. After this we are to have one a year. We&rsquo;ll
drop everything and indulge in the heaven-given luxury of loafing.
You need it. Your eyes are too big and your face too pale. I
don&rsquo;t see what has ailed me not to notice before. But right
after Christmas, dear, I&rsquo;m going to run away with you....
What are you thinking about, Lyn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, only the blessedness of being taken care of!
It&rsquo;s strange, but I know now that all my life&mdash;before
this&mdash;I was gazing at things through closed windows. Alone in
my cell I looked out&mdash;sometimes through beautiful stained
glass, to be sure&mdash;at trees waving and people passing. Now and
then some one paused and spoke to me, but always with the barrier
between. Now&mdash;I touch people&mdash;there is nothing to keep us
apart. I&rsquo;m just like everybody else; and your love and care,
Con, have set the windows wide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will never do, Lyn. Such fancies! I may have to take
you away <i>before</i> Christmas.&rdquo; Truedale spoke lightly but
his look was anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime, let us go out for a walk in the snow.
There&rsquo;s enough wind to make it a tussle. Come,
dear!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p>Two days later Lynda came down from her workshop by the back
stairs, and passed through William Truedale&rsquo;s bedchamber on
the way to the library. It was only ten o&rsquo;clock in the
morning but Truedale had a habit, if he happened to be in the
neighbourhood, of dropping in for a moment at this hour. If he
should to-day Lynda wanted to confer with him about some details
concerning the disrobing of the Saxe infants. She was particularly
light hearted and merry. A telephone call from Betty had put her in
the sunniest humour.</p>
<p>To her surprise, as she entered the library, she saw a small,
most peculiar-looking woman sitting quite straight on the edge of a
chair in the middle of the room.</p>
<p>It was a cast-iron rule that Lynda must not be disturbed at her
morning work. Thomas generally disposed of visitors without
mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo; Lynda said kindly. &ldquo;Can I do
anything for you? I am sorry you had to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She concluded it was some one connected with the Saxe Home. That
was largely in her mind at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see&rdquo;&mdash;and here the strange little
figure came to Lynda and held out a very dirty, crumpled piece of
paper on which was written Truedale&rsquo;s name and address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Truedale may not be home until evening,&rdquo; Lynda
said. And now she thought that this must be one of the private and
pet dependents of Con&rsquo;s with whom she would deal very gently
and tactfully. &ldquo;I wonder if you won&rsquo;t tell me all about
it and I will either tell Mr. Truedale or set a time for you to see
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glad of any help in this hour of extremity, the stranger
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m Nella-Rose. Do you know about
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Know about her? Why, after the first stunning shock, she seemed
to be the <i>only</i> thing Lynda did know about&mdash;ever had
known! She stared at the little figure before her for what seemed
an hour. She noted the worried, pitiful child face that, screened
behind the worn and care-lined features, looked forth like a pretty
flower. Then Lynda said, weakly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know about you&mdash;all about you,
Nella-Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pitiful eyes brightened. What Nella-Rose had been through
since leaving her hills only God understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right glad! And you&mdash;you
are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Conning Truedale&rsquo;s&mdash;wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow Lynda expected this to be a devastating shock, but it
was not. Nella-Rose was past reservations or new impressions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I reckoned so,&rdquo; was all she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must sit down. You look very tired.&rdquo; Lynda had
forgotten Truedale&rsquo;s possible appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> right tired. It&rsquo;s a mighty long way
from Pine Cone. And I was so&mdash;so frightened, but folks was
certainly good and just helped me&mdash;to here! One old lady came
to the door with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;have you come, Nella-Rose?&rdquo; Lynda drew
her own chair close to the stranger&rsquo;s and as she did so, she
could but wonder, now that she was herself again, how exactly
Nella-Rose seemed to fit into the scene. She was like a
recurrence&mdash;like some one who had played her part
before&mdash;or were the scene and Nella-Rose but the
materialization of something Lynda had always expected, always
dreaded, but which she had always known must come some day? She was
prepared now&mdash;terribly prepared! Everything depended upon her
management of the crucial moments. Her kindness did not desert her,
nor her merciful justice, but she meant to shield Truedale with her
life&mdash;hers and Nella-Rose&rsquo;s, if necessary.
&ldquo;Why&mdash;have you&mdash;come?&rdquo; she asked again, and
Nella-Rose, taking for granted that this pale, strange woman did
know all about her&mdash;knew everything and every one pertaining
to her&mdash;fixed her sweet eyes, tear-filled but not overflowing,
upon her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want&mdash;to tell him that I&rsquo;m right sorry I
hated him. I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know until Bill Trim died. I want
to ask him to&mdash;to forgive me, and&mdash;then I can go
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;did&mdash;Bill Trim tell you?&rdquo; Lynda
tried with all her strength to keep her mind cool, her thoughts
steady. She wanted to lead Nella-Rose on and on, without losing the
way herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he burned&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t mean to&mdash;he
burned the letter I sent&mdash;asking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see! You wrote&mdash;a letter, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He told me, if I wanted him&mdash;and I
did&mdash;Godda&rsquo;mighty! how I wanted him then!&rdquo;
Nella-Rose clasped her poor little work-hardened hands close, and
her small white teeth showed through the parted lips while she
struggled to regain her calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see&mdash;when I gave the letter to Bill Trim,
I&mdash;I told him&mdash;I had to&mdash;that it was Miss Lois
Ann&rsquo;s, so he didn&rsquo;t think it mattered to me; but when
he was dying&mdash;he was hurt on the big road they are making in
the hills&mdash;he was brought to us-all, and Miss Lois Ann and I
took care of him, and he grew right sorry for hating her and not
telling about the letter&mdash;and then&mdash;he spoke it
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. I see. And that was&mdash;how long ago&mdash;that
you wrote the letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nella-Rose looked back over the weary way she had travelled, to
this moment in the warm, sun-filled room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was befo&rsquo; lil&rsquo; Ann came that I sent the
letter,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Ann?&rdquo; Lynda repeated the name and something
terrible rose within her&mdash;something that would kill her unless
she conquered it. So she asked quickly, desperately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your&mdash;your child? I see. Go
on&mdash;Nella-Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote the letter and&mdash;sent it. I was hid in Miss
Lois Ann&rsquo;s cabin&mdash;it was winter&mdash;and no one found
out! Miss Lois Ann wouldn&rsquo;t believe what I told; she said
when him and me was married under the trees and God understood, it
didn&rsquo;t make me&mdash;right! She&mdash;helped me, but she
hated&mdash;him! And then when he&mdash;didn&rsquo;t come, she
taught me to&mdash;to hate, and it was right <i>black</i> hate
until lil&rsquo; Ann came. When God let her down to me&mdash;He
took the hate away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda was blinded by her tears. She could hardly see the small
figure crouching in the low chair by the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;Miss Lois Ann went and told my
folks&mdash;told Marg, my sister. Marg was married to Jed and she
was mighty scornful of me and lil&rsquo; Ann. She wouldn&rsquo;t
tell Jed and my father&mdash;she came alone to me. She told me what
folks thought. They-all thought I&rsquo;d gone away with Burke
Lawson and Marg felt sorry to see me alive&mdash;with lil&rsquo;
Ann. But Miss Lois Ann wouldn&rsquo;t let her sting me with her
tongue&mdash;she drove her away. Then&mdash;Burke came! He&rsquo;d
been a right long way off&mdash;he&rsquo;d broken his leg; he came
as soon as he could, and Marg told him and&mdash;and laid
lil&rsquo; Ann to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;never spoke? You never told?&rdquo; Lynda
had drawn very close&mdash;her words were barely above a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It was this-er-way. First, love for him held my
tongue mighty still; then hate; and afterwards I
couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now, Nella-Rose, <i>now</i>&mdash;why have you
spoken&mdash;now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t yet. Not to them-all. I had to come
here&mdash;to him first. I reckon you don&rsquo;t know about Burke
and me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda shook her head. She had thought she knew&mdash;but she had
wandered sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Marg laid my trouble to Burke he just took it! First
I couldn&rsquo;t understand. But he took my trouble&mdash;and me!
He took lil&rsquo; Ann and me out of Miss Lois Ann&rsquo;s cabin
into&mdash;peace and safety. He tied every one&rsquo;s
tongue&mdash;it seemed like he drove all the&mdash;the wrong away
by his big, strong love&mdash;and set me free, like he was God! He
didn&rsquo;t ask nothing for a right long time, not &rsquo;til I
grew to&mdash;believe him and trust him. Then we went&mdash;when no
one knew&mdash;and was married. Now he&rsquo;s my man and
he&rsquo;s always been lil&rsquo; Ann&rsquo;s father
till&mdash;till&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A log fell upon the hearth and both women started guiltily and
affrightedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on! go on!&rdquo; breathed Lynda. &ldquo;Go
on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till the twins came&mdash;Burke&rsquo;s and mine! Then he
knew the difference&mdash;even his love for me couldn&rsquo;t help
him&mdash;it hindered; and while I&mdash;I feared, I
understood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh! oh!&rdquo; Lynda covered her aching eyes with her
cold hands. She dared not look at Nella-Rose. That childish yet old
face was crowding everything but pity from the world. Truedale,
herself&mdash;what did they matter?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t bear to have lil&rsquo; Ann
touch&mdash;the babies. I could see him&mdash;shiver! And
lil&rsquo; Ann&mdash;she&rsquo;s like a flower&mdash;she fades if
you don&rsquo;t love her. She grew afraid and&mdash;and hid, and it
seemed like the soul of me would die; for, don&rsquo;t you see,
Burke thinks that Marg&rsquo;s man is&mdash;is the father, and Marg
and Jed lays the trouble to Burke and they think her&mdash;his!
And&mdash;and it has grown more since the big road brought us-all
closer. The big road brought trouble as well as good.
Once&rdquo;&mdash;and here the haggard face
whitened&mdash;&ldquo;once Burke and Jed fought&mdash;and a fight
in the hills means more fights! Just then Bill Trim was hurt and
told me before he died; it was like opening a grave! I &rsquo;most
died &rsquo;long with Bill Trim&mdash;&rsquo;til I studied about
lil&rsquo; Ann! And then&mdash;I saw wide, and right far, like I
hadn&rsquo;t since&mdash;since before I hated. I saw how I must
come and&mdash;tell you-all, and how maybe you&rsquo;d take
lil&rsquo; Ann, and then I could go back to&mdash;to my man
and&mdash;there&rsquo;ll be peace when he knows&mdash;at last! Will
you&mdash;oh! will you be with me, kind lady, when I&mdash;tell
your&mdash;your&mdash;man?&rdquo; Nella-Rose dropped at
Lynda&rsquo;s feet and was pleading like a distraught child.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so afraid. I did not know his world was so
full of noise and&mdash;and right many things. And he will
be&mdash;different&mdash;and I may not be able to make him
understand. But you will&mdash;<i>you</i> will! I must get back to
the hills. I done told Burke I&mdash;I was going to prove myself to
his goodness&mdash;by putting lil&rsquo; Ann with them as would be
mighty kind to her. I seemed to know how it would turn
out&mdash;and I dared to say it; but now&mdash;now I am
mighty&mdash;&rsquo;fraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tears were falling from the pain-racked eyes&mdash;falling
upon Lynda&rsquo;s cold, rigid hands&mdash;and they seemed to warm
her heart and clear her vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nella-Rose,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;where is little
Ann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; Ann? Why, there&rsquo;s lil&rsquo; Ann
sleeping her tire off under your pillows. She was cold and mighty
wore out.&rdquo; Nella-Rose turned toward the deep couch under the
broad window across the room.</p>
<p>Silently, like haunted creatures, both women stole toward the
couch and the mother drew away the sheltering screen of cushions.
As she did so, the little child opened her eyes, and for a moment
endeavoured to find her place in the strangeness. She looked at her
mother and smiled a slow, peculiar smile. Then she fixed her gaze
upon Lynda. It was an old, old look&mdash;but young,
too&mdash;pleading, wonder-filled. The child was so like
Truedale&mdash;so unmercifully, cruelly like him&mdash;that, for a
moment, reason deserted Lynda and she covered her face with both
hands and swayed with silent laughter.</p>
<p>Nella-Rose bent over her child as if to protect her.
&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; Ann,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;the lady is a
right kind lady&mdash;right kind!&rdquo; She felt she must explain
and justify.</p>
<p>After a moment or two Lynda gained control of her shaken nerves.
She suddenly found herself calm, and ready to undertake the
hardest, the most perilous thing that had ever come into her life.
&ldquo;Bring little Ann to the fire;&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to order some lunch, and then&mdash;we can
decide, Nella-Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nella-Rose obeyed, dumbly. She was completely under the control
of the only person, who, in this perplexed and care-filled hour,
seemed able to guide and guard her.</p>
<p>Lynda watched the two eat of the food Thomas brought in. There
was no fear of Truedale coming now. There was safety ahead for some
hours. Lynda herself made a pretext of eating, but she hardly took
her eyes from little Ann&rsquo;s face. She wanted familiarity to
take the place of shock. She must grow accustomed to that terrible
resemblance, for she knew, beyond all doubt, that it was to hold a
place in all her future life.</p>
<p>When the last drop of milk went gurgling down the little
girl&rsquo;s throat, when Nella-Rose pushed her plate aside, when
Thomas had taken away the tray, Lynda spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Nella-Rose, what are you going to&mdash;to do
with us all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tired head of little Ann was pressed against her
mother&rsquo;s breast. The food, the heat, were lulling her weary
senses into oblivion again. Lynda gave a swift thought of gratitude
for the momentary respite as she watched the small, dark face sink
from her direct view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all in your hands,&rdquo; she continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In <i>my</i> hands&mdash;<i>mine</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I must&mdash;tell him&mdash;and then go
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must you, Nella-Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else is there for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must decide. You, alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rdquo;&mdash;the lips quivered&mdash;&ldquo;you will
not go with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;cannot, Nella-Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&rdquo;&mdash;and with all her might Lynda sought
words that would lay low the difference between her and the simple,
primitive woman close to her&mdash;felt she <i>must</i> use ideas
and terms that would convey her meaning and not drive her and
Nella-Rose apart&mdash;&ldquo;because, while he is my man now, he
was first yours. Because you were first, you must go alone&mdash;if
go you must. Then he shall decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nella-Rose grasped the deep meaning after a moment and sank back
shivering. The courage and endurance that had borne her to this
hour deserted her. The help, that for a time had seemed to rise up
in Lynda, crumbled. Alone, drifting she knew not where, Nella-Rose
waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;afraid!&rdquo; she repeated over and
over. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right afraid. He&rsquo;s not the same;
it&rsquo;s all, all gone&mdash;that other life&mdash;and yet I
cannot let him think&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two women looked at each other over all that separated
them&mdash;and each comprehended! The soul of Nella-Rose demanded
justification&mdash;vindication&mdash;and Lynda knew that it should
have it, if the future were to be lived purely. There was just one
thing Lynda had to make clear in this vital moment, one truth that
must be understood without trespassing on the sacred rights of
others. Surely Nella-Rose should know all that there was to know
before coming to her final decision. So Lynda spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think he&rdquo;&mdash;she could not bring herself,
for all her bravery and sense of justice, to speak her
husband&rsquo;s name&mdash;&ldquo;you think he remembers you as
something less than you were, than you are? Nella-Rose, he never
has! He did not understand, but always he has held you sacred.
Whatever blame there may have been&mdash;he took it all. It was
because he could; because it was possible for him to do so, that I
loved him&mdash;honoured him. Had it been otherwise, as truly as
God hears me, I could not have trusted him with my life.
That&mdash;that marriage of yours and his was as holy to him as, I
now see, it was to you; and he, in his heart, has always remembered
you as he might a dear, dead&mdash;wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having spoken the words that wrung her heart, Lynda sank back
exhausted. Then she made her first&mdash;her only claim for
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was when everything was past and his new life
began&mdash;his man&rsquo;s life&mdash;that I entered in.
He&mdash;he told me everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nella-Rose bent over her sleeping child, and a wave of
compassion overflooded her thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I must think!&rdquo; she whispered, and closed
her lovely eyes. What she saw in the black space behind the burning
lids no one could know, but her tangled little life must have been
part of it. She must have seen it all&mdash;the bright, sunlit
dream fading first into shadow, then into the dun colour of the
deserted hills. Burke Lawson must have stood boldly forth, in his
supreme unselfishness and Godlike power, as her redeemer&mdash;her
man! The gray eyes suddenly opened and they were calm and
still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I only wanted him&mdash;to remember me&mdash;like
he once did,&rdquo; she faltered. She was taking her last look at
Truedale. &ldquo;So long as he&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t think
me&mdash;less; I reckon I don&rsquo;t want him&mdash;to think of me
as I am&mdash;now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose&rdquo;&mdash;the desperate demand for full
justice to Nella-Rose drove Lynda on&mdash;&ldquo;suppose it were
in your power and mine to sweep everything aside; suppose I&mdash;I
went away. What would you do, Nella-Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the eyes closed. After a moment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;would go back to&mdash;my man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that&mdash;as truly as God hears you?&mdash;you
mean that, Nella-Rose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But lil&rsquo; Ann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that she had made the great decision about Truedale, there
was still &ldquo;lil&rsquo; Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda fought for mastery over the dread thing that was forcing
its way into her consciousness. Then something Nella-Rose was
saying caught her fevered thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a lil&rsquo; child I used to dream that some
day I would do a mighty big thing&mdash;maybe this is it. I
don&rsquo;t want to hurt his life and&mdash;yours; I couldn&rsquo;t
hurt my man and&mdash;and&mdash;the babies waiting back there for
me. But&mdash;lil&rsquo; Ann!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name came like a sob. And somehow Lynda thought of Burke
Lawson! Burke, who had done his strong best, and still could not
keep himself in control because of&mdash;lil&rsquo; Ann! The
helpless baby was&mdash;oh! yes, yes&mdash;it was Truedale&rsquo;s
responsibility. If she, Lynda, were to keep her life&mdash;her
sacred love&mdash;she, too, must do a &ldquo;big
thing&rdquo;&mdash;perhaps the biggest a woman is ever called upon
to do&mdash;to prove her faith.</p>
<p>For another moment she struggled; then, like a blind woman, she
stretched out her hands and laid them upon the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nella-Rose, will you give&mdash;<i>me</i> little
Ann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give her&mdash;to&mdash;you?&rdquo; There was anguish,
doubt, but hope, in the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want&mdash;the child! She shall have her
father&mdash;her father&rsquo;s home&mdash;his love, God willing!
And I, Nella-Rose, as I hope for God&rsquo;s mercy, I will do my
duty by little Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now Lynda was on the floor beside the shabby pair, shielding
them as best she could from the last wrench and renunciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you doing this for&mdash;for your man?&rdquo;
whispered Nella-Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. For my&mdash;man!&rdquo; They looked long into each
other&rsquo;s eyes. Then solemnly, slowly, Nella-Rose relinquished
her hold of the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;give you&mdash;lil&rsquo; Ann.&rdquo; So might
she have spoken if, in religious fervour, she had been resigning
her child to death. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;give you lil&rsquo;
Ann.&rdquo; Gently she kissed the sleeping face and laid her burden
in the aching, strained arms that had still to learn their tender
lesson of bearing. Ann opened her eyes, her lips quivered, and she
turned to her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take&mdash;lil&rsquo; Ann!&rdquo; she pleaded. Then
Nella-Rose drank deep of the bitter cup, but she smiled&mdash;and
spoke one of the lies over which angels have wept forgivingly since
the world began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; Ann, the kind lady is going to keep yo&rsquo;
right safe and happy &rsquo;til mother makes things straight back
there with&mdash;with yo&rsquo;&mdash;father, in the hills.
Jes&rsquo; yo&rsquo; show the lady how sweet and pretty yo&rsquo;
can be &rsquo;til mother comes fo&rsquo; yo&rsquo;! Will
yo&rsquo;&mdash;lil&rsquo; Ann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mighty lil&rsquo; while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All her life the child had given up&mdash;shrunk from that which
she feared but did not understand; and now she accepted it all in
the dull, hopeless way in which timid children do. She received her
mother&rsquo;s kiss&mdash;gave a kiss in return; then she looked
gloomily, distrustingly, at Lynda. After that she seemed complacent
and obeyed, almost stupidly, whatever she was told to do.</p>
<p>Lynda took Nella-Rose to the station, saw to her every comfort,
put a sum of money in her hand with the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must take it, Nella-Rose&mdash;to prove your trust in
me; and it will buy some&mdash;some things for&mdash;the other
babies. But&rdquo;&mdash;and here she went close to Nella-Rose,
realizing for the first time that the most difficult part, for her,
was yet to come&mdash;&ldquo;how will it be with&mdash;with your
man&mdash;when he knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nella-Rose looked up bravely and something crept into her
eyes&mdash;the look of power that only a woman who recognizes her
hold on a man ever shows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll bear it&mdash;right grateful&mdash;and
it&rsquo;ll wipe away the hate for Jed Martin. He&rsquo;ll do the
forgiving&mdash;since I&rsquo;ve given up lil&rsquo; Ann; and if he
doubts&mdash;there&rsquo;s Miss Lois Ann. She&rsquo;s mighty
powerful with men&mdash;when it&rsquo;s women that
matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very wonderful!&rdquo; murmured Lynda.
&ldquo;More wonderful than I can understand.&rdquo; And yet as she
spoke she knew that she <i>did</i> understand. Between her and
Burke Lawson, a man she was never to know, there was a common
tie&mdash;a deep comprehension.</p>
<p>Late that afternoon Lynda drove to Betty&rsquo;s with little Ann
sitting rigidly on the seat beside her. The child had not spoken
since she had seen the train move out of the station bearing her
mother away. She had not cried or murmured. She had gone afterward,
holding Lynda&rsquo;s hand, through amazing experiences. She had
seen her shabby garments discarded in dazzling shops, and fine
apparel replace them. Once she had caught a glimpse of her small,
transformed self in a long mirror and her dark eyes had widened.
That was all. Lynda had watched her feverishly. She had hoped that
with the change of clothing the startling likeness would lessen,
but it did not. Robed in the trappings of her father&rsquo;s world,
little Ann seemed to become more wholly his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like yourself, little Ann?&rdquo; Lynda had asked
when, at last, a charming hat was placed upon the dark curls.</p>
<p>There was no word of reply&mdash;only the wide, helpless
stare&mdash;and, to cover her confusion, Lynda hurried away to
Betty.</p>
<p>The maid who admitted her said that &ldquo;Mrs. Kendall was
upstairs in the nursery with the baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda paused on the stairs and asked blankly: &ldquo;The baby?
What baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid was a trusted one and close to Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little boy from the Home, Mrs. Truedale,&rdquo; she
replied, &ldquo;and already the house is cheerfuller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda felt a distinct disappointment. She had hoped that Betty
would care for little Ann for a few days, but how could she ask it
of her now?</p>
<p>In the sunny room upstairs Betty sat in a low rocker, crooning
away to a restless bundle in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Lyn?&rdquo; Lynda stood in the doorway;
Betty&rsquo;s back was to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Betty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and see my red-headed boy&mdash;my Bobilink!
He&rsquo;s going to be Robert Kendall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Lynda drew near with Ann. Betty stopped rocking and
confronted the two with her far-reaching, strangely penetrating
gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a beautiful little girl,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she beautiful, Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s&mdash;lovely. Come here, dear, and see my
baby.&rdquo; Betty put forth a welcoming hand to the child, but Ann
shrank away and her long silence was broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I jes&rsquo; naturally hate babies!&rdquo; she whispered,
in the soft drawl that betrayed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyn, who is she? Why&mdash;what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda came close and her words did not reach past Betty&rsquo;s
strained hearing. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to&mdash;adopt
her. I&mdash;I must prepare, Con. I hoped you&rsquo;d keep her for
a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will, Lyn. I&rsquo;m ready&mdash;but Lyn,
tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty, look at her! She has come out of&mdash;of
Con&rsquo;s past. He doesn&rsquo;t know, he mustn&rsquo;t
know&mdash;not now! She belongs to&mdash;to the future. Can
you&mdash;can you understand? I never suspected until to-day.
I&rsquo;ve got to get used to it!&rdquo; Then, fiercely: &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;m going to do it, Betty! Con&rsquo;s road is my road; his
duty my duty; it&rsquo;s all right&mdash;only just at
first&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to&mdash;steady my nerves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word Betty rose and laid the now-sleeping baby in a
crib; then she came back to the low chair and opened her arms to
little Ann with the heaven-given gesture that no child
resists&mdash;especially a suffering, lonely child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, little girl, to&mdash;to Aunt Betty,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>Fascinated, Ann walked to the shelter offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you kiss me?&rdquo; Betty asked. The kiss was given
mutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell Aunt Betty your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ann what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jes&rsquo; lil&rsquo; Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Betty raised her eyes to Lynda&rsquo;s face and smiled at
its tragic suffering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, old Lyn!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;run home to Con.
You need him and God knows he needs you. It will take the big love,
Lyn, dear, the big love; but you have it&mdash;you have
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word Lynda turned and left Betty with the
children.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p>Potential motherhood can endure throes of travail other than
physical; and for the next week Lynda passed through all the phases
of spiritual readjustment that enabled her, with blessed certainty
of success, to accept what she had undertaken.</p>
<p>She did not speak to Truedale at once, but she went daily to
Betty&rsquo;s and with amazement watched the miracle Betty was
performing. She never forgot the hour, when, going softly up the
stairs, she heard little Ann laugh gleefully and clap her
hands.</p>
<p>Betty was playing with the baby and telling Ann a story at the
same time. Lynda paused to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now come here, little Ann, and kiss Bobilink.
Isn&rsquo;t he smelly-sweet and wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Kiss him again. And you once said you
just naturally didn&rsquo;t like babies! Little Ann, you are a
humbug. And now tell me how much you like Bobilink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaps and lickwigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now kiss me, you darling, and come close&mdash;so we will
not waken Bobbie. Let me see, this is going to be the story of the
little girl who adopted a&mdash;mother! Yesterday it was
Bobbie&rsquo;s story of how a mother adopted a little boy. You
remember, the mother had to have a baby to fill a big empty space,
so she went to a house where some lost kiddies were and found just
the one that fitted in and&mdash;and&mdash;but this is Ann&rsquo;s
story to-day!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once there was a little girl&mdash;a very dear and good
little girl&mdash;who knew all about a mother, and how dear a
mother was; because she had one who was obliged to go
away&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a right lil&rsquo; time?&rdquo; Ann broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Betty agreed, &ldquo;a right little
time; but the small girl thought, while she waited, that she would
adopt a mother and not tell her about the other one, for fear she
might not understand, and she&rsquo;d teach the adopted mother how
to be a real mother. And now one must remember all the things
little girls do to&mdash;to adopted mothers.
First&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point Lynda entered the room, but Betty went on
calmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, what do little girls do, Ann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teach them how to hold lil&rsquo; girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid! What next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss them and cuddle them right close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly! Next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They make mothers glad and they make them laugh&mdash;by
being mighty good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then both Betty and Ann looked at Lynda. The sharp, outer air
had brought colour to her cheeks, life to her eyes. She was very
handsome in her rich furs and dark, feathered hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, little Ann, trot along and do the lesson,
don&rsquo;t forget!&rdquo; Betty pushed the child gently toward
Lynda.</p>
<p>With a laugh, lately learned and a bit doubtful, Ann ran to the
opened arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snuggle!&rdquo; commanded Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m learning, little Ann,&rdquo; Lynda whispered,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re a dear teacher. And now I have something to
tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ann leaned back and looked with suspicion at Lynda. Her recent
past had been so crowded with events that she was wary and
overburdened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked, with more dread than
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ann, I&rsquo;m going to take you to a big house that is
waiting for a&mdash;little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child turned to Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go,&rdquo; she said, and her pretty
mouth quivered. Was she always to be sent away?&mdash;always to
have to go when she did not want to go?</p>
<p>Betty smiled into the worried little face. &ldquo;Oh!
we&rsquo;ll see each other every day,&rdquo; she comforted;
&ldquo;and besides, this is the only way you can truly adopt a
mother and play fair. It will be another dear place for Bobilink to
go for a visit, and best of all&mdash;there&rsquo;s a perfectly
splendid man in the big house&mdash;for a&mdash;for&mdash;a
father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Real fear came into Ann&rsquo;s eyes at this&mdash;fear that lay
at the root of all her trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t play
father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda drew her to her closely. &ldquo;Ann, little Ann,
don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; she pleaded passionately:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you, and together we&rsquo;ll make it come
true. We must, we must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her vehemence stilled the child. She put her hands on either
side of Lynda&rsquo;s face and timidly faltered:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, dear. And now I want to tell you something
else&mdash;we&rsquo;re going to have a Christmas tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This meant nothing to the little hill-child, so she only
stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you must come and help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have something to teach her, Lyn,&rdquo; Betty broke
in. There were tears in her eyes. &ldquo;Just think of a baby-thing
like that not knowing the thrills of Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she turned to Ann: &ldquo;Go, sweetheart,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and make a nest for Bobbie on the bed across the
hall.&rdquo; And then when Ann trotted off to do the bidding, Betty
asked: &ldquo;What did he say, Lyn, when you told him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he was glad, very glad. He has been willing, for
a long time, that I should take a child&mdash;when I saw one I
wanted. He naturally connects Ann with the Saxe Home; her being
with you has strengthened this belief. I shall let it go at
that&mdash;for a time, Betty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It is better so. After he learns to know and love
the child,&rdquo; Betty mused, &ldquo;the way will be opened. And
oh! Lyn, Ann is so wonderful. She has the most remarkable
character&mdash;so deep and tenderly true for such a
mite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose, Betty&mdash;suppose Con notices the
likeness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Betty smiled reassuringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t. Men are so stupidly humble. A pretty
little girl would escape them every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But her Southern accent, Betty. It is so
pronounced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Lyn, it is! She sometimes talks like a little
darkey; but to my certain knowledge there are ten small Southerners
at the Saxe, of assorted ages and sexes, waiting for
adoption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she may speak out, Betty. Her silence as to the past
will disappear when she has got over her fear and
longing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty looked more serious. &ldquo;I doubt it. Not a word has
passed her lips here&mdash;of her mother or home. It has amazed me.
She&rsquo;s the most unusual, the most fascinating creature I ever
saw, for her age. Brace is wild about her&mdash;he wants me to keep
her. But, Lyn, if she does break her strange silence, it will be
your big hour! Whatever Con is or isn&rsquo;t&mdash;and sometimes I
feel like hugging him, and again, like shaking him&mdash;he&rsquo;s
the tenderest man with women&mdash;not even excepting
Brace&mdash;that I have ever seen. It never has occurred to him to
reason out how much you love him&mdash;he&rsquo;s too busy loving
you. But when he finds this out! Well, Lyn, it makes me bow my head
and speak low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Betty! Don&rsquo;t suggest pedestals
again,&rdquo; Lynda pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No pedestal, Lyn; no pedestal&mdash;but the real,
splendid <i>you</i> revealed at last! And now&mdash;forget it,
dear. Here comes lil&rsquo; Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child tiptoed in with outstretched arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nest is made right soft,&rdquo; she whispered,
&ldquo;and now let me carry Bobilink to&mdash;to the sleepy
dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you learn to carry babies?&rdquo; Betty
hazarded, testing the silence. The small, dark face clouded; the
fear-look crept to the large eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the only reply,
and Ann turned away&mdash;this time toward Lynda!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose he never knows?&rdquo; Lynda spoke with her
lips pressed to Ann&rsquo;s soft hair&mdash;the child was in her
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you and Con will have something to begin heaven
with.&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s eyes were wet. &ldquo;We all have
something we don&rsquo;t talk about much on earth&mdash;we do not
dare. Brace and I have our&mdash;baby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two days later Lynda took Ann home. They went shopping first and
the child was dazzlingly excited. She forgot her restraint and
shyness in the fascinating delirium of telling what she wanted with
a pretty sure belief that she would get it. No wonder that she was
taken out of herself and broke upon Truedale&rsquo;s astonished
gaze as quite a different child from the one Lynda had
described.</p>
<p>The brilliant little thing came into the hall with Lynda, her
arms filled with packages too precious to be consigned to other
hands; her eyes were dancing and her voice thrilling with
happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I&rsquo;ll call you muvver-Lyn &rsquo;cause
you&rsquo;re mighty kind and this is your house! It&rsquo;s a right
fine house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale had well timed his return home. He was ready to greet
the two in the library. The prattling voice charmed him with its
delightful mellowness and he went forward gladly to meet Lynda and
the new little child. Ann was ahead; Lynda fell back and, with
fast-throbbing heart waited by the doorway.</p>
<p>Ann had had a week and more of Brace Kendall to wipe away the
impression Burke Lawson had imprinted upon her mind. But she was
shy of men and weighed them carefully before showing favours. She
stood still when she saw Truedale; she dropped, unheeded, a
package; she stared at him, while he waited with extended hands.
Then slowly&mdash;as if drawn against her will&mdash;Ann advanced
and laid her hands in his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is the little girl who has come to help us make
Christmas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Still that fixed look. It seemed to Lynda the
most unnatural thing she had ever seen. And oh! how alike the two
were, now that they were together!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are little Ann and you are going to play
with&rdquo;&mdash;Truedale looked toward Lynda and drew her to him
by the love in his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;You are going to play with us,
and you will call us mother and father, won&rsquo;t you, little
Ann?&rdquo; He meant to do his part in full. He would withhold
nothing, now that Lynda had decided to take this step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you suppose you could kiss me&mdash;to begin
with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quaintly the child lifted herself on her toes&mdash;Truedale was
half kneeling before her&mdash;and gave him a lingering kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be great friends, eh, little
Ann?&rdquo; Truedale was pleased, Lynda saw that. The little girl
was making a deep impression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Then&mdash;deliberately: &ldquo;Shall I have
to teach you to be a father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does she mean?&rdquo; Truedale looked at Lynda who
explained Betty&rsquo;s charming foolery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Well, yes, Ann, you must teach me to be a
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they began their lives together. And after a few days
Lynda saw that during the child&rsquo;s stay with Betty the crust
of sullen reserve had departed&mdash;the little creature was the
merriest, sweetest thing imaginable, once she could forget herself.
Protected, cared for, and considered, she developed marvellously
and soon seemed to have been with them years instead of days. The
impression was almost startling and both Lynda and Truedale
remarked upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are certain things she does that appear always to
have been waiting for her to do,&rdquo; Conning said, &ldquo;it
makes her very charming. She brushes the dogs and cats regularly,
and she&rsquo;s begun to pick up books and papers in my den in a
most alarming way&mdash;but she always manages to know where they
belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s uncanny,&rdquo; Lynda ventured; &ldquo;but
she certainly has fitted in, bless her heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There had been moments at first when Lynda feared that Thomas
would remember the child, but the old eyes could hardly be expected
to recognize, in the dainty little girl, the small, patched, and
soiled stranger of the annoying visit. Many times had Thomas
explained and apologized for the admittance of the two
&ldquo;forlornities,&rdquo; as he called them.</p>
<p>No, everything seemed mercifully blurred; and Ann, in her new
home, apparently forgot everything that lay behind her. She never
even asked to go back to Betty&rsquo;s though she welcomed Betty,
Brace, and Bobbie with flattering joy whenever they came to visit.
She learned to be very fond of Lynda&mdash;was often sweetly
affectionate with her; but in the wonderful home, her very own,
waited upon and cared for, it was Conning who most appealed to her.
For him she watched and waited at the close of day, and if she were
out with Lynda she became nervous and worried if they were delayed
as darkness crept on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want father to see me waiting,&rdquo; she would urge;
&ldquo;I like to see his gladness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so do I!&rdquo; Lynda would say, struggling to
overcome the unworthy resentment that occasionally got the better
of her when the child too fervently appropriated Conning.</p>
<p>But this trait of Ann&rsquo;s flattered and delighted Truedale;
often he was amused, but he knew that it was the one thing above
all else in the little girl that endeared her to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a darling she is!&rdquo; he often said to Lynda when
they were alone together. &ldquo;Is she ever naughty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, often&mdash;the monkey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it. I hate a flabby youngster.
Does she ever speak of her little past, Lyn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that strange?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m glad she doesn&rsquo;t. I want her to
forget. She&rsquo;s very happy with us&mdash;but she&rsquo;s far
from perfect.&rdquo; &ldquo;To what form of cussedness does she
tend, Lyn? With me she&rsquo;s as lamblike as can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! she has a fiery temper and, now that I think of it,
she generally shows it in reference to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me?&rdquo; Truedale smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Thomas found her blacking your shoes the other day.
She was making an awful mess of it and he tried to take them from
her. She gave him a real vicious whack with the brush. What she
said was actually comical: &rsquo;He&rsquo;s mine; if I want to
take the dirt from his shoes, I can. He <i>shan&rsquo;t</i> walk on
dirt&mdash;and he&rsquo;s mine!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little rascal. And what did Thomas do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he let her. People always let her. I do
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a fascinating kid,&rdquo; Truedale said with
a laugh. Then, very earnestly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather glad we do
not know her antecedents, Lyn; it&rsquo;s safer to take her as we
find her and build on that. But I&rsquo;d be willing to risk a good
deal that much love and goodness are back of little Ann, no matter
how much else got twisted in. And the love and goodness must be her
passport through life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Con, and they are all that are worth
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But every change was a period of struggle to Ann and those who
dealt with her. She had a passionate power of attachment to places
and people, and readjustment caused her pain and unrest.</p>
<p>When school was considered, it almost made her ill. She clung to
Truedale and implored him not to make her go away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s only for the day time, Ann,&rdquo; he
explained, &ldquo;and you will have children to play
with&mdash;little girls like yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; no! I don&rsquo;t want children&mdash;only Bobbie! I
only want my folks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda came to her defense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Con, we&rsquo;ll have a governess for a year or
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it wise, Lyn, to give way to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is!&rdquo; Ann burst in; &ldquo;it is wise,
I&rsquo;d die if I had to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she had a governess and made gratifying strides in learning.
The trait that was noticeable in the child was that she developed
and thrived most when not opposed. She wilted mentally and
physically when forced. She had a most unusual power of winning and
holding love, and under a shy and gentle exterior there were
passion and strength that at times were pathetic. While not a
robust child she was generally well and as time passed she gained
in vigour. Once, and once only, was she seriously ill, and that was
when she had been with Truedale and Lynda about two years. During
all that time, as far as they knew, she had never referred to the
past and both believed that, for her, it was dead; but when
weakness and fever loosened the unchildlike control, something
occurred that alarmed Lynda, but broke down forever the thin
barrier that, for all her effort, had existed between her and Ann.
She was sitting alone with the child during a spell of delirium,
when suddenly the little hot hands reached up passionately, and the
name &ldquo;mother&rdquo; quivered on the dry lips in a tone
unfamiliar to Lynda&rsquo;s ears. She bent close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, little Ann?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>The big, burning eyes looked puzzled. Then: &ldquo;Take me
to&mdash;to the Hollow&mdash;to Miss Lois Ann!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; panted Lynda, every nerve tingling.
&ldquo;See, little Ann&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child seemed to half understand and moaned plaintively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m lost! I&rsquo;m lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda took her in her arms and the sick fancy passed, but from
that hour there was a new tie between the two&mdash;a deeper
dependence.</p>
<p>There was one day when they all felt little Ann was slipping
from them. Dr. McPherson had come as near giving up hope as he
ever, outwardly, permitted himself to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better stay at home,&rdquo; he said to Conning;
&ldquo;children are skittish little craft. The best of them haul up
anchor sometimes when you least expect it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Truedale remained at home and, wandering through the quiet
house, wondered at the intensity of his suffering as he
contemplated the time on ahead without the child who had so
recently come into his life from he knew not where. He attributed
it all to Ann&rsquo;s remarkable characteristics.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon of the anxious day he went into the sick
room and leaned over the bed. Ann opened her eyes and smiled up at
him, weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a light, father,&rdquo; she whispered, and with a
fear-filled heart Truedale touched the electric button. The room
was already filled with sunlight, for it faced the west; but for
Ann it was cold and dark.</p>
<p>Then, as if setting the last pitiful scene for her own
departure, she turned to Lynda: &ldquo;Make a mother-lap for
Ann,&rdquo; she said. Lynda tenderly lifted the thin form from the
bed and held it close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I taught you how to be a mother, didn&rsquo;t I,
mommy-Lyn?&rdquo; she had never called Lynda simply
&ldquo;mother,&rdquo; while &ldquo;father&rdquo; had fallen
naturally from her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, little Ann.&rdquo; Lynda&rsquo;s eyes were
filled with tears and in that moment she realized how much the
child meant to her. She had done her duty, had exceeded it at
times, in her determination not to fall short. She had humoured
Ann, often taking sides against Conning in her fear of being
unjust. But oh! there had always been something lacking; and now,
too late, she felt that, for all her struggle, she had not been
true to the vow she had made to Nella-Rose!</p>
<p>But Ann was gazing up at her with a strange, penetrating
look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the comfiest lap in the world,&rdquo; she
faltered, &ldquo;for little, tired girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I love her!&rdquo; Lynda gazed up at Truedale as
if confessing and, at the end, seeking forgiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you do!&rdquo; he comforted,
&ldquo;but&mdash;be brave, Lyn!&rdquo; He feared to excite Ann.
Then the weary eyes of the child turned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mommy-Lyn does love me!&rdquo; the weak voice was barely
audible; &ldquo;she does, father, she does!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was like a confirmation&mdash;a recognition of something
beautiful and sacred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt,&rdquo; Lynda said afterward to Betty, &ldquo;as
if she were not only telling Con, but God, too. I had not deserved
it&mdash;but it made up for all the hard struggle, and swept
everything before it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ann did not die. Slowly, almost hesitatingly, she turned
back to them and brought a new power with her. She, apparently,
left her baby looks and nature in the shadowy place from which she
had escaped. Once health came to her, she was the merriest of merry
children&mdash;almost noisy at times&mdash;in the rollicking
fashion of Betty&rsquo;s irrepressible Bobilink. And the haunting
likeness to Truedale was gone. For a year or two the lean, thready
little girl looked like no one but her own elfish self; and
then&mdash;it was like a revealment&mdash;she grew to be like
Nella-Rose!</p>
<p>Lynda, at times, was breathless as she looked and remembered.
She had seen the mother only once; but that hour had burned the
image of face, form, and action into her soul. She recalled, too,
Conning&rsquo;s graphic description of his first meeting with
Nella-Rose. The quaint, dramatic power that had marked Ann&rsquo;s
mother, now developed in the little daughter. She had almost
entirely lost the lingering manner of speech&mdash;the Southern
expressions and words&mdash;but she was as different from the
children with whom she mingled as she had ever been.</p>
<p>When she was strong enough she resumed her studies with the
governess and also began music. This she enjoyed with the passion
that marked her attitude toward any person or thing she loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it lets something in me, free!&rdquo; she confided to
Truedale. &ldquo;I shall never be naughty or unkind again&mdash;I
wouldn&rsquo;t dare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Conning was no devotee of music and was
puzzled by Ann&rsquo;s intensity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she replied, puckering her brows in the
effort to make herself clear, &ldquo;I&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t be
worthy of&mdash;of the beautiful music, if I were
horrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale laughed and patted her pretty cropped head, over which
the new little curls were clustering.</p>
<p>Life in the old house was full and rich at that time. Conning
was, as he often said, respectably busy and important enough in the
affairs of men to be content; he would never be one who enjoyed
personal power.</p>
<p>Lynda, during Ann&rsquo;s first years, had taken a partner who
attended to interviews, conferences, and contracts; but in the room
over the extension the creative work went on with unabated
interest. Little Ann soon learned to love the place and had her
tiny chair beside the hearth or table. There she learned the
lessons of consideration for others, and self-control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the day comes,&rdquo; Lynda told Betty, &ldquo;when my
work interferes with my duty to Con and Ann, it will go! But more
and more I am inclined to think that the interference is a matter
of choice. I prefer my profession to&mdash;well, other
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Betty agreed; &ldquo;women should not
be forever coddling their offspring, and when they learn to call
things by their right names and develop some initiative, they
won&rsquo;t whine so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda and Truedale had sadly abandoned the hope of children of
their own. It was harder for Lynda than for Con, but she accepted
what seemed her fate and thanked heaven anew for little Ann and the
sure sense that she could love her without reserve.</p>
<p>And then, after the years of change and readjustment,
Lynda&rsquo;s boy was born! He seemed to crown everything with a
sacred meaning. Not without great fear and doubt did Lynda go down
into the shadow; not without an agony of apprehension did Truedale
go with her to the boundary over which she must pass alone to
accept what God had in store for her. They remembered with sudden
and sharp anxiety the peril that Betty had endured, though neither
spoke of it; and always they smiled courageously when most their
hearts failed.</p>
<p>Then came the black hours of suffering and doubt. A wild storm
was beating outside and Truedale, hearing it, wondered whether all
the great events of his life were to be attended by those outbursts
of nature. He walked the floor of his room or hung over
Lynda&rsquo;s bed, and at midnight, when she no longer knew him or
could soothe him by her brave smile, he went wretchedly away and
upon the dim landing of the stairs came upon Ann, crouching white
and haggard.</p>
<p>His nerves were at the breaking point and he spoke sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you not in bed?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While&mdash;mommy-Lyn is&mdash;in&mdash;there?&rdquo;
gasped the girl, turning reproachful eyes up to him.
&ldquo;How&mdash;could I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always; always!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ann, you must go to your room at once! Come, I will go
with you.&rdquo; She rose and took his hand. There was fear in her
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is mommy-Lyn&mdash;&rdquo; she faltered, and
Truedale understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&mdash;no!&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;not
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was to&mdash;to stay close to you.&rdquo; Ann was
trembling as she walked beside him. &ldquo;She gave you&mdash;to
me! She gave you to me&mdash;to keep for her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale stopped short and looked at Ann. Confusedly he grasped
the meaning of the tie that held this child to Lynda&mdash;that
held them all to the strong, loving woman who was making her fight
with death, for a life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Ann,&rdquo; was all he could say, but he bent and
kissed the child solemnly.</p>
<p>When morning dawned, Lynda came back&mdash;bringing her little
son with her. God had spoken!</p>
<p>Truedale, sitting beside her, one hand upon the downy head that
had nearly cost so much, saw the mother-lips move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;want&mdash;the baby?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I want little Ann.&rdquo; Then the white lids
fell, shutting away the weak tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyn, the darling has been waiting outside your door all
night&mdash;I imagine she is there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. I want her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you able&mdash;just now, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;must have little Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Ann came. She was white&mdash;very much awed; but she smiled.
Lynda did not open her eyes at once; she was trying to get back
some of the old self-control that had been so mercilessly shattered
during the hours of her struggle, but presently she looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;kept your word, Ann,&rdquo; she said. Then:
&ldquo;You&mdash;you made a place for my baby. Little
Ann&mdash;kiss your&mdash;brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They named the baby for William Truedale and they called him
Billy, in deference to his pretty baby ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be Uncle William&rsquo;s representative,&rdquo;
said Lynda, &ldquo;as Bobbie is the representative of Betty&rsquo;s
little dead boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I often think of&mdash;the money, Lyn.&rdquo; Truedale
spoke slowly and seriously. &ldquo;How I hated it; how I tried to
get rid of it! But when it is used rightly it seems to secure
dignity for itself. I&rsquo;ve learned to respect it, and I want
our boy to respect it also. I want to put it on a firm foundation
and make it part of Billy&rsquo;s equipment&mdash;a big trust for
which he must be trained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I would like his training to precede his
knowledge of the money as far as possible,&rdquo; Lynda replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like him to put up a bit of a fight&mdash;as his
father did before him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As his father did <i>not</i>!&rdquo; Truedale&rsquo;s
eyes grew gloomy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Lyn, I&rsquo;m
constructed on the modelling plan&mdash;added to, built up. Some
fellows are chiselled out. I wonder&mdash;about little
Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow&rdquo;&mdash;Lynda gave a little contented
smile&mdash;&ldquo;I am not afraid for Billy. But I would not take
the glory of conflict from him&mdash;no! not for all Uncle
William&rsquo;s money! He must do his part in the world and find
his place&mdash;not the place others may choose for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be sterner with him than you are
with Ann, aren&rsquo;t you, Lyn?&rdquo; Truedale meant this
lightly, but Lynda looked serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be able to, Con, for Billy brought something with
him that Ann had to find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see&mdash;I see! That&rsquo;s where a mother comes in
strong, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Con, it&rsquo;s where she comes in with fear and
trembling&mdash;but with an awful comprehension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This &ldquo;comprehension&rdquo; of the responsibilities of
maternity worked forward and backward with Lynda much to
Truedale&rsquo;s secret amusement. Confident of her duty to her
son, she interpreted her duty to Ann. While Billy, red-faced and
roving-eyed, gurgled or howled in his extreme youth, Lynda retraced
her steps and commandingly repaired some damages in her treatment
of Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ann,&rdquo; she said one day, &ldquo;you must go to
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Ann naturally asked. She was a conscientious
little student and extremely happy with the governess who came
daily to instruct her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You study and learn splendidly, Ann, but you must
have&mdash;have children in your life. You&rsquo;ll be
queer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got Bobbie, and now Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ann, do not argue. When Billy is old enough to go to
school he is going, without a word! I&rsquo;ve been too weak with
you, Ann&mdash;you&rsquo;ll understand by and by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new tone quelled any desire on Ann&rsquo;s part to insist
further; she was rather awed by this attitude. So, with a lofty,
detached air Miss Ann went to school. At first she imbibed
knowledge under protest, much as she might have eaten food she
disliked but which she believed was good for her. Then certain
aspects of the new experience attracted and awakened her. From the
mass of things she ought to know, she clutched at things she wanted
to know. From the girls who shared her school hours, she selected
congenial spirits and worshipped them, while the others, for her,
did not exist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s so intense,&rdquo; sighed Lynda;
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s just courting suffering. She lavishes everything
on them she loves and grieves like one without hope when things go
against her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the most dramatic little imp.&rdquo; Truedale
laughed reminiscently as he spoke&mdash;he had seen Ann in two or
three school performances. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if she
had genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty looked serious when she heard this. &ldquo;I hope
not!&rdquo; was all she said, and from then on she watched Ann with
brooding eyes; she urged Lynda to keep her much out of doors in the
companionship of Bobbie and Billy who were normal to a relieving
extent. Ann played and enjoyed the babies&mdash;she adored Billy
and permitted him to rule over her with no light hand&mdash;but
when she could, she read poetry and talked of strange, imaginative
things with the few girls in whose presence she became rapt and
reverent.</p>
<p>Brace was the only one who took Ann as a joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s working out her fool ideas, young,&rdquo; he
comforted; &ldquo;let her alone. A boy would go behind some barn
and smoke and revel in the idea that he was a devil of a fellow.
Annie&rdquo;&mdash;he, alone, called her that&mdash;&ldquo;Annie is
smoking her tobacco behind her little barns. She&rsquo;ll get good
and sick of it. Let her learn her lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Betty admitted, &ldquo;girls
ought to learn, just as boys do&mdash;but if I ever find
<i>Bobbie</i> smoking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do to him, Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not sure, but I <i>do</i> know I&rsquo;d
insist upon his coming from behind barns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that led them all to consider Ann from the barn standpoint.
If she wanted the tragic and sombre she should have it&mdash;in the
sunlight and surrounded with love. So she no longer was obliged to
depend on the queer little girls who fluttered like blind bats in
the crude of their adolescent years. Lynda, Betty, Truedale, and
Brace read bloodcurdling horrors to her and took her to
plays&mdash;the best. And they wedged in a deal of wholesome,
commonplace fun that presently awoke a response and developed a
sense of humour that gave them all a belief that the worst was
past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has forgotten everything that lies back of her
sickness,&rdquo; Lynda once said to Betty; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
strange, but she appears to have begun from that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Betty made a remark that Lynda recalled afterward:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she has, Lyn. I&rsquo;m not worried
about Ann as you and Con are. Her Lady Macbeth pose is just plain
girl; but she has depths we have never sounded. Sometimes I think
she hides them to prove her gratitude and affection, and because
she is so helpless. She was nearly five when she came to you, Lyn,
and I believe she does remember the hills and her
mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Betty, what makes you think this?&rdquo; Lynda was
appalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is her eyes. There are moments when she is looking
back&mdash;far back. She is trying to hold to something that is
escaping her. Love her, Lyn, love her as you never have
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I thought that, Betty!&rdquo; Lynda was aghast.
&ldquo;Oh! Betty&mdash;the poor darling! I cannot believe she could
be so strong&mdash;so&mdash;terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more or less subconscious&mdash;such things
always are&mdash;but I think Ann will some day prove what I say. In
a way, it&rsquo;s like the feeling I have for&mdash;for my own
baby, Lyn. I see him in Bobbie; I feel him in Bobbie&rsquo;s
dearness and naughtiness. Ann holds what went before in what is
around her now. Sometimes it puzzles her as Bobbie puzzles
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About this time&mdash;probably because he was happier than he
had ever been before, possibly because he had more time that he
could conscientiously call his own than he had had for many a
well-spent year&mdash;Truedale repaired to his room under the
eaves, sneaking away, with a half-guilty longing, to his old play!
So many times had he resurrected it, then cast it aside; so many
hopes and fears had been born and killed by the interruption to his
work, that he feared whatever strength it might once have had must
be gone now forever.</p>
<p>Still he retreated to his attic room once more&mdash;and Lynda
asked no questions. With strange understanding Ann guarded that
door like a veritable dragon. When Billy&rsquo;s toddling steps
followed his father Ann waylaid him; and many were the swift,
silent struggles near the portal before the rampant Billy was
carried away kicking with Ann&rsquo;s firm hand stifling his
outraged cries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Daddy doing there?&rdquo; Billy would demand when
once conquered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s business but
Daddy&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Ann unrelentingly insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I want to know!&rdquo; Billy pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until Daddy wants you to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the eaves, hope grew in Truedale&rsquo;s heart. The old
play had certainly the subtle human interest that is always vital.
He was sure of that. Once, he almost decided to take Ann into his
confidence. The child had such a dramatic sense. Then he laughed.
It was absurd, of course!</p>
<p>No! if the thing ever amounted to anything&mdash;if, by putting
flesh upon the dry bones and blood into the veins, he could get it
over&mdash;it was to be his gift to Lynda! And the only thing that
encouraged him as he worked, rather stiffly after all the years,
was the certainty that at times he heard the heart beat in the
shrunken and shrivelled thing! And so&mdash;he reverently worked
on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<p>Among the notes and suggestions sprinkled through the old
manuscript were lines that once had aroused the sick and bitter
resentment of Truedale in the past:</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">&ldquo;Thy story hath been
written long since.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy part is to read and
interpret.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Over and over again he read the words and pondered upon his own
change of mind. Youth, no matter how lean and beggared it may be,
craves and insists upon conflict&mdash;upon the personal loss and
gain. But as time takes one into its secrets, the soul gets the
wider&mdash;Truedale now was sure it was the wider&mdash;outlook.
Having fought&mdash;because the fight was part of the written
story&mdash;the craving for victory, of the lesser sort, dwindled,
while the higher call made its appeal. To be part of the universal;
to look back upon the steps that led up, or even down, and hold the
firm belief that here, or elsewhere&mdash;what mattered in the
mighty chain of many links&mdash;the &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo;
told!</p>
<p>Truedale came to the conclusion that fatalism was no weak and
spineless philosophy, but one for the making of strong souls.</p>
<p>Failure, even wrong, might they not, if unfettered by the narrow
limitations of here and now, prove miracle-working elements?</p>
<p>Then the effect upon others entered into Truedale&rsquo;s
musings as it had in the beginning. The &ldquo;stories&rdquo; of
others! He leaned his head at this juncture upon his clasped hands
and thought of Nella-Rose! Thought of her as he always
did&mdash;tenderly, gently, but as holding no actual part in his
real life. She was like something that had gained power over an
errant and unbridled phase of his past existence. He could not make
her real in the sense of the reality of the men, women, and affairs
that now sternly moulded and commanded him. She was&mdash;she
always would be to him&mdash;a memory of something lovely, dear,
but elusive. He could no longer place and fix her. She belonged to
that strange period of his life when, in the process of finding
himself, he had blindly plunged forward without stopping to count
the cost or waiting for clear-sightedness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has she become?&rdquo; he thought, sitting apart
with his secret work. And then most fervently he hoped that what
Lynda had once suggested might indeed be true. He prayed, as such
men do pray, that the experience which had enabled him to
understand himself and life better might also have given Nella-Rose
a wider, freer space in which to play her chosen part.</p>
<p>He recalled his knowledge of the hill-women as Jim White had
described them&mdash;women to whom love, in its brightest aspect,
is denied. Surely Nella-Rose had caught a glimpse more radiant than
they. Had it pointed her to the heaven of good
women&mdash;or&mdash;?</p>
<p>And eventually this theme held and swayed the play&mdash;this
effect of a deep love upon such a nature as Nella-Rose&rsquo;s, the
propelling power&mdash;the redeeming and strengthening influence.
In the end Truedale called his work &ldquo;The
Interpretation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while this was going on behind the attic door, a seemingly
slight incident had the effect of reinforcing Truedale&rsquo;s
growing belief in his philosophy.</p>
<p>He and Lynda went one day to the studio of a sculptor who had
suddenly come into fame because of a wonderful figure, half human,
half divine, that had startled the sophisticated critics out of
their usual calm.</p>
<p>The man had done much good work before, but nothing remarkable;
he had taken his years of labour with patient courage, insisting
that they were but preparation. He had half starved in the
beginning&mdash;had gradually made his way to what every one
believed was a mediocre standstill; but he kept his faith and his
cheerful outlook, and then&mdash;he quietly presented the
remarkable figure that demanded recognition and appreciation.</p>
<p>The artist had sold his masterpiece for a sum that might
reasonably have caused some excitement in his life&mdash;but it had
not!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I let the thing go,&rdquo; he confided to
a chosen few; &ldquo;come and help me bid it good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda and Conning were among the chosen, and upon the afternoon
of their call they happened to be alone with him in the studio.</p>
<p>All other pieces of work had been put away; the figure, in the
best possible light, stood alone; and the master, in the most
impersonal way, stood guard over it with reverent touch and hushed
voice.</p>
<p>Had his attitude been a pose it would have been ridiculous; but
it was so detached, so sincere, so absolutely humble, that it rose
to the height of dignified simplicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thornton, where did you get your inspiration&mdash;your
model?&rdquo; Truedale asked, after the beauty of the thing had
sunk into his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the clay. Such things are always in the clay,&rdquo;
was the quiet reply.</p>
<p>Lynda was deeply moved, not only by the statue, but by its
creator. &ldquo;Tell us, please,&rdquo; she said earnestly,
&ldquo;just what you mean. I think it will help us to
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thornton gave a nervous laugh. He was a shy, retiring man but he
thought now only of this thing he had been permitted to
portray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always&rdquo;&mdash;he began
hesitatingly&mdash;&ldquo;take my plaster in big lumps, squeeze it
haphazard, and then sit and look at it. After that, it is a mere
matter of choice and labour and&mdash;determination. When
this&rdquo;&mdash;he raised his calm eyes to the
figure&mdash;&ldquo;came to me&mdash;in the clay&mdash;I saw it as
plainly as I see it now. I couldn&rsquo;t forget, or, if I did, I
began again. Sometimes, I confess, I got weird results as I worked;
once, after three days of toil, a&mdash;a devil was evolved. It
wasn&rsquo;t bad, either, I almost decided to&mdash;to keep it; but
soon again I caught a glimpse of the vision, always lurking close.
So I pinched and smoothed off and added to, and, in the end, the
vision stayed. It was in the clay&mdash;everything is, with me. If
I cannot see it there, I might as well give up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thornton, that&rsquo;s why you never lost courage!&rdquo;
Truedale exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the reason, old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda came close. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said with deep
feeling in her voice, &ldquo;I do understand; I thought I would if
you explained, and&mdash;I think your method
is&mdash;Godlike!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thornton flushed and laughed. &ldquo;Hardly that,&rdquo; he
returned, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s merely my way and I have to take
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was late summer when Truedale completed the play. Lynda and
the children were away; the city was hot and comparatively empty.
It was a time when no manager wanted to look at manuscripts, but if
one was forced upon him, he would have more leisure to examine it
than he would have later on.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this, Truedale&mdash;anxious but strangely
insistent&mdash;fought his way past the men hired to defeat such a
course, and got into the presence of a manager whose opinion he
could trust.</p>
<p>After much argument&mdash;and the heat was terrific&mdash;the
great man promised, in order to rid himself of Truedale&rsquo;s
presence, to read the stuff. He hadn&rsquo;t the slightest
intention of doing so, and meant to start it on its downward way
back to the author as soon as the proper person&mdash;in short his
private secretary&mdash;came home from his vacation.</p>
<p>But that evening an actress who was fine enough and charmingly
temperamental enough to compel attention, bore down through the
heat upon the manager, with the appalling declaration that she was
tired to death of the part selected for her in her play, and would
have none of it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But good Lord!&rdquo; cried the manager, fanning himself
with his panama&mdash;they were at a roof garden
restaurant&mdash;&ldquo;this is August&mdash;and you go on in
October.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as a depraved and sensual woman, Mr. Camden; I want
to be for once in my life a character that women can remember
without blushing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my poor child, that&rsquo;s your splendid art. You
are a&mdash;an angel-woman, but you can play a she-devil like an
inspired creature. You don&rsquo;t mean that you seriously
contemplate ruining <i>my</i> reputation and your
own&mdash;by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said the angel-woman, sipping her
sauterne, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t care a flip for your reputation
or mine&mdash;the weather&rsquo;s too hot&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not
going to trail through another slimy play! No; I&rsquo;ll go into
the movies first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Camden twisted his collar; he felt as if he were choking.
&ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; was all he could manage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want woods and the open! I want a character with a
little, twisted, unawakened soul to be unsnarled and made to behave
itself. I don&rsquo;t mind being a bit naughty&mdash;if I can be
spanked into decorum. But when the curtain goes down on my next
play, Camden, the women are going out of the theatre with a kind
thought of me, not throbbing with disapproval&mdash;good women, I
mean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, because Camden was a bit of a sentimentalist with a
good deal of superstition tangled in his make-up, he took
Truedale&rsquo;s play out of his pocket&mdash;it had been spoiling
the set of his coat all the evening&mdash;and spread it out on the
table that was cleared now of all but the coffee and the cigarettes
which the angel-woman&mdash;Camden did not smoke&mdash;was puffing
luxuriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some rot that a fellow managed to drop on me
to-day. I didn&rsquo;t mean to undo it, but if it has an
out-of-door setting, I&rsquo;ll give it a glance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it?&rdquo; asked the angel, watching the perspiring
face of Camden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has! Big open. Hills&mdash;expensive open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it rot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph&mdash;listen to this!&rdquo; Camden&rsquo;s sharp
eye lighted on a vivid sentence or two. &ldquo;Not the usual type
of villain&mdash;and the girl is rather unique. Up to tricks with
her eyes shut. I wonder how she&rsquo;ll pan out?&rdquo; Camden
turned the pages rapidly, overlooking some of Con&rsquo;s best
work, but getting what he, himself, was after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! she doesn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;push those matches this way&mdash;what
doesn&rsquo;t she do?&rdquo; asked the angel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eternally damn the man and claim her sex privilege of
unwarranted righteousness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she damn herself&mdash;like an idiot?&rdquo; The
angel was interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does not! She plays her own little r&ocirc;le by the
music of the experience she lived through. It&rsquo;s not bad, by
the lord Harry! It&rsquo;s got to be tinkered&mdash;and painted
up&mdash;but it&rsquo;s original. Just look it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale&rsquo;s play was pushed across the table and the
angel-woman seized upon it. The taste Camden had given
her&mdash;like caviar&mdash;sharpened her appetite. She read on in
the swift, skipping fashion that would have crushed an
author&rsquo;s hopes, but which grasped the high lights and caught
the deep tones. Then the woman looked up and there were genuine
tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little brick!&rdquo; said the voice of loveliness and
thrills, &ldquo;the splendid little trump! Why, Camden, she had her
ideals&mdash;real, fresh, woman-ideals&mdash;not the ideals
plastered on us women by men, who would loathe them for themselves!
She just picked up the scraps of her damaged little affairs and
went, without a whimper, to the doing of the only job she could
ever hope to succeed in. And she let the man-who-learned go! Gee!
but that was a big decision. She might so easily have muddled the
whole scheme of things, but she didn&rsquo;t! The dear, little,
scrimpy, patched darling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Camden, I want to be that girl for as long a run as
you can force. After the first few weeks you won&rsquo;t have to
bribe folks to come&mdash;it&rsquo;ll take hold, after they have
got rid of bad tastes in their mouths and have found out what
we&rsquo;re up to! Don&rsquo;t count the cost, Camden. This is a
chance for civic virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want more cigarettes, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve smoked enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Camden drew the manuscript toward him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
damned rough diamond,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you and I know it is a diamond, don&rsquo;t we,
Camby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it sparkles&mdash;here and there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it mustn&rsquo;t be ruined in the cutting and
setting, must it?&rdquo; The angel was wearing her most devout and
flattering expression. She was handling her man with inspired
touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph! Well, no. The thing needs a master hand; no doubt
of that. But good Lord! think of the cost. This out-of-door stuff
costs like all creation. Your gowns will let you out easy&mdash;you
can economize on <i>this</i> engagement&mdash;but have a heart and
think of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I do think of you, Camby. You know as well as I
that New York is at your beck and call. What you say&mdash;goes!
Call them now to see something that will make them sure the world
isn&rsquo;t going to the devil, Camden. In this
scene&rdquo;&mdash;and here the woman pulled the manuscript
back&mdash;&ldquo;when that little queen totes her heavy but
sanctified heart up the trail, men and women will shed tears that
will do them good&mdash;tears that will make them see plain duty
clearer. Men and&mdash;yes, women, too, Camby&mdash;<i>want</i> to
be decent, only they&rsquo;ve lost the way. This will help them to
find it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to have two strong men.&rdquo; Camden
dared not look at the pleading face opposite. But something was
already making him agree with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, by heavens, I don&rsquo;t know of but one who
isn&rsquo;t taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a boy&mdash;he&rsquo;s only had minor parts
so far&mdash;but I want him for the man-who-learned-his-lesson. You
can give the big wood-giant to John Harrington&mdash;I heard to-day
that he was drifting, up to date&mdash;but I want Timmy Nichols for
the other part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nichols? Thunder! He&rsquo;s only done&mdash;what in the
dickens has he done? I remember him, but I can&rsquo;t recall his
parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s it! Now I want him to drive
his part home&mdash;with himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Camden looked across at the vivid young face that a brief but
brilliant career had not ruined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to understand,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you, Camden? Well, I&rsquo;m only beginning to
understand myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Together, you&rsquo;ll be corking!&rdquo; Camden suddenly
grew enthusiastic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t we? And he did so hate to have me slimy. No
one but Timmy and my mother ever cared!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have this&mdash;this fellow who wrote the
play&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truedale.&rdquo; The woman referred to the
manuscript.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Truedale. We&rsquo;ll have him to dinner to-morrow.
I&rsquo;ll get Harrington and Nichols. Where shall we
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a love of a place over on the East Side.
They give you such good things to eat&mdash;and leave you
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was November before the rush and hurry of preparation were
over and Truedale&rsquo;s play announced. His name did not appear
on it so his people were not nerve-torn and desperate. Truedale
often was, but he managed to hide the worst and suffer in silence.
He had outlived the anguish of seeing his offspring amputated,
ripped open, and stuffed. He had come to the point where he could
hear his sacredest expressions denounced as rot and supplanted by
others that made him mentally ill. But in the end he acknowledged,
nerve-racked as he was, that the thing of which he had
dreamed&mdash;the thing he had tried to do&mdash;remained intact.
His eyes were moist when the curtain fell upon his
&ldquo;Interpretation&rdquo; at the final rehearsal.</p>
<p>Then he turned his attention to his personal drama. He chose his
box; there were to be Lynda and Ann, Brace and Betty, McPherson and
himself in it. Betty, Brace, and the doctor were to have the three
front chairs&mdash;not because of undue humility on the
author&rsquo;s part, but because there would, of course, be a big
moment of revelation&mdash;a moment when Lynda would know! When
that came it would be better to be where curious eyes could not
behold them. Perhaps&mdash;Truedale was a bit anxious over
this&mdash;perhaps he might have to take Lynda away after the first
act, and before the second began, in order to give her time and
opportunity to rally her splendid serenity.</p>
<p>And after the play was over&mdash;after he knew how the audience
had taken it&mdash;there was to be a small supper&mdash;just the
six of them&mdash;and during that he would confess, for better or
worse. He would revel in their joy, if success were his, or lean
upon their sympathy if Fate proved unkind.</p>
<p>Truedale selected the restaurant, arranged for the flowers, and
then grew so rigidly quiet and pale that Lynda declared that the
summer in town had all but killed him and insisted that he take a
vacation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had our annual honeymoon trip,
Con,&rdquo; she pleaded; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s take it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll&mdash;we&rsquo;ll go, Lyn, just before
Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; Lynda tossed her head. &ldquo;It will
take our united efforts from December first until after Christmas
to meet the demands of Billy and Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Lyn, the theatre season has just
opened&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a silly, Con. What do we care for that?
Besides, we can go to some place where there are theatres.
It&rsquo;s too cold to go into the wilds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But New York is <i>the</i> place, Lyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Con, I never saw you so obstinate and frivolous. Why,
you&rsquo;re thin and pale, and you worry me. I will never leave
you again during the summer. Ann was edgy about it this year. She
told me once that she felt all the hotness you were suffering. I
believe she did! <i>Now</i> will you come away for a
month?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I cannot, Lyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For two weeks, then? One?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling, after next week, yes! For a week or ten
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Con! Always so reasonable and&mdash;kind,&rdquo;
Lynda lifted her happy face to his....</p>
<p>But things did not happen as Truedale arranged&mdash;not all of
them. There was a brief tussle, the opening night of the play, with
McPherson. He didn&rsquo;t see why he should be obliged to sit in
the front row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too tall and fat!&rdquo; he protested;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s like putting me on exhibition. Besides, my dress
suit is too small for me and my shirt-front bulges and&mdash;and
I&rsquo;m not pretty. Put the women in front, Truedale. What ails
you, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conning was desperate. For a moment it looked as if the burly
doctor were going to defeat everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate plays, you know!&rdquo; McPherson was mumbling;
&ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you bring us to a musical comedy or
vaudeville? Lord! but it&rsquo;s hot here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty, watching Truedale&rsquo;s exasperated face, came to his
assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When at a party you&rsquo;re asked whether you will have
tea or coffee, Dr. McPherson,&rdquo; she said, tugging at his huge
arm, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t say &rsquo;chocolate,&rsquo; it
isn&rsquo;t polite. If Con wants to mix up the sexes he has a
perfect right to, after he&rsquo;s ruined himself buying this box.
Do sit down beside me, doctor. When the audience looks at my
perfectly beautiful new gown they&rsquo;ll forget your reputation
and shirt-front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, muttering and frowning, McPherson sat down beside Betty, and
Brace in lamblike mood dropped beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wicked,&rdquo; McPherson turned once more;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Ann can see a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can, Dr. McPherson&mdash;if you keep put! I want
to sit between father and mommy-Lyn. When I thrill, I have to have
near me some one particular, to hold on to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be in bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Ann leaned against his shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
grumpy,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I like you best of
all&mdash;when you&rsquo;re not the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; grunted McPherson, but he stayed
&ldquo;put&rdquo; after that, until the curtain went down on the
first act. Then he turned to Truedale. He had been laughing until
the tears stood in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did that big woodsman make you think of any one?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he remind <i>you</i> of any one?&rdquo; Truedale
returned. He was weak with excitement. Lynda, sitting beside him,
was almost as white as the gown she wore&mdash;for she had
remembered the old play!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s enough like old Jim White to be his twin! I
haven&rsquo;t laughed so much in a month. I feel as if I&rsquo;d
had a vacation in the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the curtain went up on the big scene! Camden had spared no
expense. That was his way. The audience broke into appreciative
applause as it gazed at the realistic reproduction of deep woods,
dim trails, and a sky of gold. It was an empty stage&mdash;a
waiting moment!</p>
<p>In the first act the characters had been more or less
subservient to the big honest sheriff, with his knowledge of the
people and his amazing interpretation of justice. He had been so
wise&mdash;so deliciously anarchistic&mdash;that the real motive of
the play had only begun to appear. But now into the beautiful,
lonely woods the woman came! The shabby, radiant little creature
with her tremendous problem yet to solve. Through the act she rose
higher, clearer; she won sympathy, she revealed herself; and, at
the end, she faced her audience with an appeal that was successful
to the last degree.</p>
<p>In short, she had got Truedale&rsquo;s play over the footlights!
He knew it; every one knew it. And when the climax came and the
decision was made&mdash;leaving the man-who-had-learned-his-lesson
unaware of the divine renunciation but strong enough to take up his
life clear-sightedly; when the little heroine lifted her eyes and
her empty arms to the trail leading up and into the mysterious
woods&mdash;and to all that she knew they held&mdash;something
happened to Truedale! He felt the clutch of a small cold hand on
his. He looked around, and into the wide eyes of Ann! The child
seemed hypnotized and, as if touched by a magic power, her
resemblance to her mother fairly radiated from her face. She was
struggling for expression. Seeking to find words that would convey
what she was experiencing. It was like remembering indistinctly
another country and scene, whose language had been forgotten.
Then&mdash;and only Lynda and Truedale heard&mdash;little Ann
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Nella-Rose! Father, it&rsquo;s
Nella-Rose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty had been right. The shock had, for a moment, drawn the
veil aside, the child was looking back&mdash;back; she heard what
others had called the one she now remembered&mdash;the sacreder
name had escaped her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, it&rsquo;s Nella-Rose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale continued to look at Ann. Like a dying man&mdash;or one
suddenly born into full life&mdash;he gradually understood! As Ann
looked at that moment, so had Nella-Rose looked when, in
Truedale&rsquo;s cabin, she turned her eyes to the window and saw
his face!</p>
<p>This was Nella-Rose&rsquo;s child, but why had Lynda&mdash;? And
with this thought such a wave of emotion swept over Truedale that
he feared, strong as he was, that he was going to lose
consciousness. For a moment he struggled with sheer physical
sensation, but he kept his eyes upon the small, dark face turned
trustingly to his. Then he realized that people were moving about;
the body of the house was nearly empty; McPherson, while helping
Betty on with her cloak, was commenting upon the play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good stuff!&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Some muscle in
that. Not the usual appeal to the uglier side of life. But come,
come, Mrs. Kendall, stop crying. It&rsquo;s only a play, after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I know,&rdquo; Betty quiveringly replied, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s so human, Dr. McPherson. That dear little woman has
almost broken my heart; but she&rsquo;d have broken it utterly if
she had acted differently. I don&rsquo;t believe the author ever
<i>guessed</i> her! Somewhere she <i>lived</i> and played her part.
I just know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truedale heard all this while he watched the strained look
fading from Ann&rsquo;s face. The past was releasing her, giving
her back to the safe, normal present. Presently she laughed and
said: &ldquo;Father, I feel so queer. Just as if I&rsquo;d
been&mdash;dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she turned with a deep, relieving sigh to Lynda.
&ldquo;Thank you for bringing me, mommy-Lyn,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;it was the best play I&rsquo;ve ever seen in all my life.
Only I wish that nice actress-lady had gone with the man who
didn&rsquo;t know. I&mdash;I feel real sorry for him. And why
didn&rsquo;t she go?&mdash;I&rsquo;d have gone as quick as
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door had closed between Ann&rsquo;s past and her future!
Truedale got upon his feet, but he was still dazed and uncertain as
to what he should do next. Then he heard Lynda say, and it almost
seemed as if she spoke from a distance she could not cross,
&ldquo;Little Ann, bring father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at Lynda and her white face startled him, but she
smiled the kind, true smile that called upon him to play his
part.</p>
<p>Somehow the rest of the plan ran as if no cruel jar had preceded
it. The supper was perfect&mdash;the guests merry&mdash;and, when
he could command himself, Truedale&mdash;keeping his eyes on
Lynda&rsquo;s face&mdash;confessed.</p>
<p>For a moment every one was quiet. Surprise, delight, stayed
speech. Then Ann asked: &ldquo;And did you do it behind the locked
door, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad I kept Billy out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Lyn&mdash;did you know?&rdquo; Betty said, her pretty
face aglow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the men kept still after the cordial handshakes. McPherson
was recalling something Jim White had said to him recently while he
was with the sheriff in the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doc, that thar chap yo&rsquo; once sent down
here&mdash;thar war a lot to him us-all didn&rsquo;t catch
onter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Brace was thinking of the night, long, long ago, when
Conning threw some letters upon the glowing coals and groaned!</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<p>They were home at last in old William Truedale&rsquo;s quiet
house. Conning went upstairs with Ann. Generally Lynda went with
him to kiss Ann good-night before they bent over Billy&rsquo;s crib
beside their own bed. But now, Lynda did not join them and Ann,
starry-eyed, prattled on about the play and her joy in her
father&rsquo;s achievement. She was very quaint and droll. She ran
behind a screen and dropped her pretty dress, and issued forth,
like a white-robed angel, in her long gown, her short brown curls
falling like a beautiful frame around her gravely sweet face.</p>
<p>Truedale, sitting by the shaded lamp, looked at her as if, in
her true character, she stood revealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Ann,&rdquo; he said huskily, &ldquo;come, let me
hold you while we wait for mommy-Lyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ann came gladly and nestled against his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think it&rsquo;s my daddy that made the splendid
play!&rdquo; she whispered, cuddling closer. &ldquo;I can tell the
girls and be so proud.&rdquo; Then she yawned softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mommy-Lyn, I suppose, had to go and whisper the secret to
Billy,&rdquo; she went on, finding as usual an excuse instead of a
rebuke. &ldquo;Billy&rsquo;s missed the glory of his life because
he&rsquo;s so young!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another&mdash;a longer yawn. Then the head lay very still and
Truedale saw that she was asleep. Reverently he kissed her. Then he
bore her to the little bed behind the white screen, with its tall
angels with brooding eyes. As he laid her down she looked up
dreamily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a pretty big girl to be carried,&rdquo; she
whispered, &ldquo;but my daddy is strong and&mdash;and
great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Truedale kissed her, then went noiselessly to find
Lynda.</p>
<p>He went to their bedchamber, but Lynda was not there. Billy,
rosy and with fat arms raised above his pretty blond head, was
sleeping&mdash;unconscious of what was passing near. Truedale went
and looked yearningly down at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy!&rdquo; he murmured over and over again; &ldquo;my
boy.&rdquo; But he did not kiss Billy just then.</p>
<p>There was no doubt in Truedale&rsquo;s mind, now, as to where he
would find Lynda. Quietly he went downstairs and into the dim
library. The fire was out upon the hearth. The gray ashes gave no
sign of life. The ticking of the clock was cruelly loud; and there,
beside the low, empty chair, knelt Lynda&mdash;her white dress
falling about her in motionless folds.</p>
<p>Truedale, without premeditation, crossed the room and, sitting
in his uncle&rsquo;s chair&mdash;the long-empty chair, lifted
Lynda&rsquo;s face and held it in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyn,&rdquo; he said, fixing his dark, troubled eyes upon
hers, &ldquo;Lyn, who is Ann&rsquo;s father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda had not been crying; her eyes were dry
and&mdash;faithful!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Con,&rdquo; she said, quietly.</p>
<p>During the past years had Lynda ever permitted herself to
imagine how Conning would meet this hour she could not have asked
more than now he gave. He was ready, she saw that, to assume
whatever was his to bear. His face whitened; his mouth twitched as
the truth of what he heard sunk into his soul; but his gaze never
fell from that which was raised to his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you&mdash;tell me all about it, Lyn?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>For an instant Lynda hesitated. Misunderstanding, Truedale
added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d rather not to-night! I can wait. I
trust you absolutely. I am sure you acted wisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Con, it was not I&mdash;not I. It was Nella-Rose who
acted wisely. I left it all to her! It was she who decided. I have
always wanted, at least for years, to have you know; but it was
Nella-Rose&rsquo;s wish that you should not. And now, little Ann
has made it possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Lynda told him. He had relinquished his hold upon her
and sat with tightly clenched hands gazing at the ashes on the
hearth. Lynda pressed against him, watching&mdash;watching the
effect of every word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Con, at first, when I knew, every fibre of my being
claimed you! I wanted to push her and&mdash;and Ann away, but I
could not! Then I tried to act for you. I saw that since Nella-Rose
had been first in your life she should have whatever belonged to
her; I knew that you would have it so. When I could bring myself
to&mdash;to stand aside, I put us all into her keeping. She was
very frightened, very pitiable, but she closed her eyes and I knew
that she saw truth&mdash;the big truth that stood guard over all
our lives and had to be dealt with honestly&mdash;or it would crush
everything. I could see, as I watched her quiet face, that she was
feeling her way back, back. Then she realized what it all meant.
Out of the struggle&mdash;the doubt&mdash;that big, splendid
husband of hers rose supreme&mdash;her man! He had saved her when
she had been most hopelessly lost. Whatever now threatened him had
to go! Her girlhood dream faded and the safe reality of what he
stood for remained. Then she opened her eyes and made her great
decision. Since you had never dishonoured her in your thought, she
would not have you know her as she then was! But&mdash;there
remained little Ann! Oh! Con, I never knew, until Billy came, what
Nella-Rose&rsquo;s sacrifice meant! I thought I did&mdash;but
afterward, I knew! One has to go down into the Valley to find the
meaning of motherhood. I had done, or tried to do, my duty before,
but Billy taught me to love Ann and understand&mdash;the
rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment. Among the white ashes a tiny red
spark was showing. It glowed and throbbed; it was trying hard to
find something upon which to live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Lyn, after she went back to the hills&mdash;how was
it with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She laid everything but your name upon the soul of her
man. He never exacted more. His love was big enough&mdash;divine
enough&mdash;to accept. Oh! Con, through all the years when I have
tried to&mdash;to do my part, the husband of Nella-Rose has helped
me to do it! Nella-Rose never looked back&mdash;to Ann and me.
Having laid the child upon the altar, she&mdash;trusted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that would be her way.&rdquo; Truedale&rsquo;s voice
broke a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Con, I kept in touch with her through that wonderful
old woman&mdash;Lois Ann. I&mdash;oh! Con, I made life easier,
brighter for them all; just as&mdash;as you would have done. Lois
Ann has told me of the happiness of the little cabin home, of the
children&mdash;there are three&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sharp pause caused Truedale to turn and look at Lynda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Con, Nella-Rose died last year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stillness in the room pressed close; even the clock&rsquo;s
ticking was unnoticed. The spark upon the hearth had become a
flame; it had found something upon which to feed. Like a radiant
hope it rose, faded, then leaped higher among the white ashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went, Con, like a child tired of its play. She was
with Lois Ann; it was the hill-fever, and she was mercifully spared
the knowledge of suffering or&mdash;renunciation. She kept
repeating that she saw beautiful things; she was glad&mdash;glad to
the last minute. Her children and husband have gone to
Nella-Rose&rsquo;s old home. Lois Ann says they are saving
everybody! That&rsquo;s all, Con&mdash;all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Truedale, his eyes dim but undaunted, leaned and drew Lynda
up until, kneeling before him, her hands upon his shoulders, they
faced each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the way women&mdash;save men!&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the way they try to save&mdash;themselves,&rdquo;
Lynda replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Con, Con, when will our men learn that it is the one
life, the one great love that we women want?&mdash;the full
knowledge and&mdash;responsibility?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling!&rdquo; Truedale kissed the tender mouth. Then
drawing her close, he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember that day in Thornton&rsquo;s
studio&mdash;and his words? Looking back at my life, I cannot
understand&mdash;I may never understand&mdash;what the Creator
meant, but I do know that it was all in the clay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynda drew away&mdash;her hands still holding him. Her brave
smile was softening her pale face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! the dear, dear clay!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;The
clay that has been pressed and moulded&mdash;how I love it. I also
do not understand, Con, but this I know: the Master never lost the
vision in the clay.&rdquo;</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
